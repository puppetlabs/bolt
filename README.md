[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bolt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/bolt)

Bolt is a ruby command-line tool for executing commands and scripts on remote
systems using ssh and winrm.

## Goals

* Execute commands on remote *nix and Windows systems
* Distribute and execute scripts, e.g. bash, powershell, python
* Scale to upwards of 1000 concurrent connections
* Support industry standard protocols (ssh/scp, winrm/psrp) and authentication
  methods (password, publickey)

## Supported Platforms

* Linux, OSX, Windows
* Ruby 2.1+

## Getting started

Install it with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org).

    gem install bolt

Or add this to your Gemfile if you are using [Bundler](https://bundler.io).

    gem 'bolt'

Or run from source

    bundle install --path .bundle
    bundle exec bolt exec --nodes <name> command='hostname -f'

See `bolt --help` for more details.

Bolt relies on gems with native extensions, and the process for building them varies by platform:

### CentOS 7/Redhat 7

    yum install -y make gcc ruby-devel

### Fedora 25

In addition to the above packages, Fedora requires:

    dnf install -y make gcc redhat-rpm-config ruby-devel rubygem-rdoc

### Debian 9/Ubuntu 16.04

    apt-get install -y make gcc ruby-dev

### OSX

Either install XCode or the Command Line Tools. The latter can be done from the command line:

     xcode-select --install

### Windows

Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), then install `ruby` and `ruby.devkit`:

    choco install ruby
    choco install ruby.devkit

## Kudos

Thank you to [Marcin Bunsch](https://github.com/marcinbunsch) for allowing
Puppet to use the `bolt` gem name.

## Testing

Some tests expect a windows or linux vm to be running. Execute `vagrant up` to
bring these up using the included Vagrantfile. Any tests requiring this are
tagged with `:vagrant` in rspec. To exclude these tests run:

    $ bundle exec rspec spec --tag ~vagrant
