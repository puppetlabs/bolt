# Writing plans in YAML

YAML plans run a list of steps in order, which allows you to define simple workflows. Steps can contain embedded Puppet code expressions to add logic where necessary.

**Note:** YAML plans are an experimental feature and might experience breaking changes in future minor \(y\) releases.

## Naming plans

Plan names are named based on the filename of the plan, the name of the module containing the plan, and the path to the plan within the module.

Place plan files in your module's `./plans` directory, using these file extensions:

-   Puppet plans — `.pp`
-   YAML plans — `.yaml`, not `.yml`

Plan names are composed of two or more name segments, indicating:

-   The name of the module the plan is located in.
-   The name of the plan file, without the extension.
-   The path within the module, if the plan is in a subdirectory of `./plans`.

For example, given a module called `mymodule` with a plan defined in `./mymodule/plans/myplan.pp`, the plan name is `mymodule::myplan`. A plan defined in `./mymodule/plans/service/myplan.pp`would be `mymodule::service::myplan`. This name is how you refer to the plan when you run commands.

The plan filename `init` is special: the plan it defines is referenced using the module name only. For example, in a module called `mymodule`, the plan defined in `init.pp` is the `mymodule` plan.

Avoid giving plans the same names as constructs in the Puppet language. Although plans do not share their namespace with other language constructs, giving plans these names makes your code difficult to read.

Each plan name segment must begin with a lowercase letter and:

-   May include lowercase letters.
-   May include digits.
-   May include underscores.
-   Must not be a [reserved word](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.3/lang_reserved.html).
-   Must not have the same name as any Puppet data types.
-   Namespace segments must match the following regular expression `\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\Z`


## Plan structure

YAML plans contain a list of steps with optional parameters and results.

YAML maps accept these keys:

-   `steps`: The list of steps to perform
-   `parameters`: \(Optional\) The parameters accepted by the plan
-   `return`: \(Optional\) The value to return from the plan

### Steps key

The `steps` key is an array of step objects, each of which corresponds to a specific action to take.

When the plan runs, each step is executed in order. If a step fails, the plan halts execution and raises an error containing the result of the step that failed.

Steps use these fields:

-   `name`: A unique name that can be used to refer to the result of the step later
-   `description`: \(Optional\) An explanation of what the step is doing.

Other available keys depend on the type of step.

#### Command step

Use a `command` step to run a single command on a list of targets and save the results, containing stdout, stderr, and exit code.

The step fails if the exit code of any command is non-zero.

Command steps use these fields:

-   `command`: The command to run
-   `target`: A target or list of targets to run the command on

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - command: hostname -f
    target:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    description: "Get the webserver hostnames"
```

#### Task step

Use a `task` step to run a Bolt task on a list of targets and save the results.

Task steps use these fields:

-   `task`: The task to run
-   `target`: A target or list of targets to run the task on
-   `parameters`: \(Optional\) A map of parameter values to pass to the task

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - task: package
    target:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    description: "Check the version of the openssl package on the webservers"
    parameters:
      action: status
      name: openssl
```

#### Script step

Use a `script` step to run a script on a list of targets and save the results.

The script must be in the `files/` directory of a module. The name of the script must be specified as `<modulename>/path/to/script`, omitting the `files` directory from the path.

Script steps use these fields:

-   `script`: The script to run
-   `target`: A target or list of targets to run the script on
-   `arguments`: \(Optional\) An array of command-line arguments to pass to the script

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: mymodule/check_server.sh
    target:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    description: "Run mymodule/files/check_server.sh on the webservers"
    arguments:
      - "/index.html"
      - 60
```

#### File upload step

Use a file upload step to upload a file to a specific location on a list of targets.

The file to upload must be in the `files/` directory of a Puppet module. The source for the file must be specified as `<modulename>/path/to/file`, omitting the `files` directory from the path.

File upload steps use these fields:

-   `source`: The location of the file to be uploaded
-   `destination`: The location to upload the file to

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - source: mymodule/motd.txt
    destination: /etc/motd
    target:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    description: "Upload motd to the webservers"
```

#### Plan step

Use a `plan` step to run another plan and save its result.

Plan steps use these fields:

-   `plan`: The name of the plan to run
-   `parameters`: \(Optional\) A map of parameter values to pass to the plan

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - plan: facts
    description: "Gather facts for the webservers using the built-in facts plan"
    parameters:
      nodes:
        - web1.example.com
        - web2.example.com
        - web3.example.com
```

#### Resources step

Use a `resources` step to apply a list of Puppet resources. A resource defines the desired state for part of a target. Bolt ensures each resource is in its desired state. Like the steps in a `plan`, if any resource in the list fails, the rest are skipped.

For each `resources` step, Bolt executes the `apply_prep` plan function against the targets specified with the `targets` field. For more information about `apply_prep` see the [Applying manifest blocks](applying_manifest_blocks.md#) section.

Resources steps use these fields:

-   `resources`: An array of resources to apply
-   `target`: A target or list of targets to apply the resources on

Each resource is a YAML map with a type and title, and optionally a `parameters` key. The resource type and title can either be specified separately with the `type` and `title` keys, or can be specified in a single line by using the type name as a key with the title as its value.

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - resources:
    # This resource is type 'package' and title 'nginx'
    - package: nginx
      parameters:
        ensure: latest
    # This resource is type 'service' and title 'nginx'
    - type: service
      title: nginx
      parameters:
        ensure: running
    target:
      - web1.example.com
      - web2.example.com
      - web3.example.com
    description: "Set up nginx on the webservers"
```

### Parameters key

Plans accept parameters with the `parameters` key. The value of `parameters` is a map, where each key is the name of a parameter and the value is a map describing the parameter.

Parameter values can be referenced from steps as variables.

Parameters use these fields:

-   `type`: \(Optional\) A valid [Puppet data type](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data.html#puppet-data-types). The value supplied must match the type or the plan fails.
-   `default`: \(Optional\) Used if no value is given for the parameter
-   `description`: \(Optional\)


For example, this plan accepts a `load_balancer` name as a string, two sets of nodes called `frontends` and `backends`, and a `version` string:

```yaml
parameters:
  # A simple parameter definition doesn't need a type or description
  load_balancer:
  frontends:
    type: TargetSpec
    description: "The frontend web servers"
  backends:
    type: TargetSpec
    description: "The backend application servers"
  version:
    type: String
    description: "The new application version to deploy"
```

### How strings are evaluated

The behavior of strings is defined by how they're written in the plan.

`'single-quoted strings'` are treated as string literals without any interpolation.

`"double-quoted strings"` are treated as Puppet language double-quoted strings with variable interpolation.

`| block-style strings` are treated as expressions of arbitrary Puppet code. Note the string itself must be on a new line after the `|` character.

`bare strings` are treated dynamically based on their content. If they begin with a `$`, they're treated as Puppet code expressions. Otherwise, they're treated as YAML literals.

Here's an example of different kinds of strings in use:

```yaml
parameters:
  message:
    type: String
    default: "hello"

steps:
  - eval: hello
    description: 'This will evaluate to: hello'
  - eval: $message
    description: 'This will evaluate to: hello'
  - eval: '$message'
    description: 'This will evaluate to: $message'
  - eval: "${message} world"
    description: 'This will evaluate to: hello world'
  - eval: |
      [$message, $message, $message].join(" ")
    description: 'This will evaluate to: hello hello hello'
```

## Using variables and simple expressions

Parameters and step results are available as variables during plan execution, and they can be used to compute the value for each field of a step.

The simplest way to use a variable is to reference it directly by name. For example, this plan takes a parameter called `nodes` and passes it as the target list to a step:

```yaml
parameters:
  nodes:
    type: TargetSpec

steps:
  - command: hostname -f
    target: $nodes
```

Variables can also be interpolated into string values. The string must be double-quoted to allow interpolation. For example:

```yaml
parameters:
  username:
    type: String

steps:
  - task: echo
    parameters:
      message: "hello ${username}"
    target: $nodes
```

Many operations can be performed on variables to compute new values for step parameters or other fields.

### Indexing arrays or hashes

You can retrieve a value from an Array or a Hash using the `[]` operator. This operator can also be used when interpolating a value inside a string.

```yaml
parameters:
  users:
    # Array[String] is a Puppet data type representing an array of strings
    type: Array[String]

steps:
  - task: user::add
    target: 'host.example.com'
    parameters:
      name: $users[0]
  - task: echo
    target: 'host.example.com'
    parameters:
      message: "hello ${users[0]}"
```

### Calling functions

You can call a built-in [Bolt function](plan_functions.md#) or [Puppet function](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/function.html) to compute a value.

```yaml
parameters:
  users:
    type: Array[String]

steps:
  - task: user::add
    parameters:
      name: $users.first
  - task: echo
    message: "hello ${users.join(',')}"
```

### Using code blocks

Some Puppet functions take a block of code as an argument. For instance, you can filter an array of items based on the result of a block of code.

The result of the `filter` function is an array here, not a string, because the expression isn't inside quotes.

```yaml
parameters:
  numbers:
    type: Array[Integer]

steps:
  - task: sum
    description: "add up the numbers > 5"
    parameters:
      indexes: $numbers.filter |$num| { $num > 5 }
```

## Connecting steps

You can connect multiple steps by using the result of one step to compute the parameters for another step.

### `name` key

The `name` key makes its result available to later steps in a variable with that name.

This example uses the `map` function to get the value of `stdout` from each command result and then joins them into a single string separated by commas.

```yaml
parameters:
  nodes:
    type: TargetSpec

steps:
  - name: hostnames
    command: hostname -f
    target: $nodes
  - task: echo
    parameters:
      message: $hostnames.map |$hostname_result| { $hostname_result['stdout'] }.join(',')
```

### `eval` step

The `eval` step evaluates an expression and saves the result in a variable. This is useful to compute a variable to use multiple times later.

```yaml
parameters:
  count:
    type: Integer

steps:
  - name: double_count
    eval: $count * 2
  - task: echo
    target: web1.example.com
    parameters:
      message: "The count is ${count}, and twice the count is ${double_count}"
```

## Returning results

You can return a result from a plan by setting the `return` key at the top level of the plan. When the plan finishes, the `return` key is evaluated and returned as the result of the plan. If no `return` key is set, the plan returns `undef`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: hostnames
    command: hostname -f
    target: $nodes

return: $hostnames.map |$hostname_result| { $hostname_result['stdout'] }
```

## Computing complex values

To compute complex values, you can use a Puppet code expression as the value of any field of a step except the `name`.

Bolt loads the plan as a YAML data structure. As it executes each step, it evaluates any expressions embedded in the step. Each plan parameter and the values of every previous named step are available in scope.

This lets you take advantage of the power of Puppet language in the places it's necessary, while keeping the rest of your plan simple.

When your plans need more sophisticated control flow or error handling beyond running a list of steps in order, it's time to convert them to [Puppet language plans](writing_plans.md#).

## Converting YAML plans to Puppet language plans

You can convert a YAML plan to a Puppet language plan with the `bolt plan convert` command.

```
bolt plan convert path/to/my/plan.yaml
```

This command takes the relative or absolute path to the YAML plan to be converted and prints the converted Puppet language plan to stdout.

**Note:** Converting a YAML plan might result in a Puppet plan which is syntactically correct, but behaves differently. Always manually verify a converted Puppet language plan's functionality. There are some constructs that do not translate from YAML plans to Puppet language plans. These are [listed](#yaml-plan-constructs-that-cannot-be-translated-to-puppet-plans) below. If you convert a YAML plan to Puppet and it changes behavior, [file an issue](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues) in Bolt's Git repo.

For example, with this YAML plan:

```yaml
# site-modules/mymodule/plans/yamlplan.yaml
parameters:
  nodes:
    type: TargetSpec
steps:
  - name: run_task
    task: sample
    target: $nodes
    parameters:
      message: "hello world"
return: $run_task
```

Run the following conversion:

```console
$ bolt plan convert site-modules/mymodule/plans/yamlplan.yaml
# WARNING: This is an autogenerated plan. It may not behave as expected.
plan mymodule::yamlplan(
  TargetSpec $nodes
) {
  $run_task = run_task('sample', $nodes, {'message' => "hello world"})
  return $run_task
}
```

## Quirks when converting YAML plans to Puppet language plans

There are some quirks and limitations associated with converting a plan expressed in YAML to a plan expressed in the Puppet language. In some cases it is impossible to accurately translate from YAML to Puppet. In others, code that is generated from the conversion is syntactically correct but not idiomatic Puppet code.

### Named `eval` step

The `eval` step allows snippets of Puppet code to be expressed in YAML plans. When converting a multi-line `eval` step to Puppet code and storing the result in a variable, use the `with` lambda.

For example, here is a YAML plan with a multi-line `eval` step:

```yaml
parameters:
  foo:
    type: Optional[Integer]
    description: foo
    default: 0

steps:
  - eval: |
      $x = $foo + 1
      $x * 2
    name: eval_step

return: $eval_step
```

And here is the same plan, converted to the Puppet language:

```
plan yaml_plans::with_lambda(
  Optional[Integer] $foo = 0
) {
  $eval_step = with() || {
    $x = $foo + 1
    $x * 2
  }

  return $eval_step
}
```

Writing this plan from scratch using the Puppet language, you would probably not use the lambda. In this example the converted Puppet code is correct, but not as natural or readable as it could be.

### Resource step variable interpolation

When applying Puppet resources in a `resource` step, variable interpolation behaves differently in YAML plans and Puppet language plans. To illustrate this difference, consider this YAML plan:

```yaml
steps:
  - target: localhost
    description: Apply a file resource
    resources:
    - type: file
      title: '/tmp/foo'
      parameters:
        content: $facts['os']['family']
        ensure: present
  - name: file_contents
    description: Read contents of file managed with file resource
    eval: >
      file::read('/tmp/foo')
      
return: $file_contents

```

This plan performs `apply_prep` on a localhost target. Then it uses a Puppet `file` resource to write the OS family discovered from the Puppet `$facts` hash to a temporary file. Finally, it reads the value written to the file and returns it. Running `bolt plan convert` on this plan produces this Puppet code:

```
plan yaml_plans::interpolation_pp() {
  apply_prep('localhost')
  $interpolation = apply('localhost') {
    file { '/tmp/foo':
      content => $facts['os']['family'],
      ensure => 'present',
    }
  }
  $file_contents = file::read('/tmp/foo')

  return $file_contents
}
```

This Puppet language plan works as expected, whereas the YAML plan it was converted from fails. The failure stems from the `$facts`variable being resolved as a plan variable, instead of being evaluated as part of compiling the manifest code in an `apply`block.

### Dependency order

The resources in a `resources` list are applied in order. It is possible to set dependencies explicitly, but when doing so you must refer to them in a particular way. Consider the following YAML plan:

```yaml
parameters:
  nodes:
    type: TargetSpec
steps:
  - name: pkg
    target: $nodes
    resources:
      - title: openssh-server
        type: package
        parameters:
          ensure: present
          before: File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config']
      - title: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        type: file
        parameters:
          ensure: file
          mode: '0600'
          content: ''
          require: Package['openssh-server']
```

Executing this plan fails during catalog compilation because of how Bolt parses the resources referenced in the `before` and `require` parameters. You will see the error message `Could not find resource 'File['/etc/ssh/sshd_config']' in parameter 'before'`. The solution is to not quote the resource titles:

```yaml
parameters:
  nodes:
    type: TargetSpec
steps:
  - name: pkg
    target: $nodes
    resources:
      - title: openssh-server
        type: package
        parameters:
          ensure: present
          before: File[/etc/ssh/sshd_config]
      - title: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        type: file
        parameters:
          ensure: file
          mode: '0600'
          content: ''
          require: Package[openssh-server]
```

In general, declare resources in order. This is an unusual example to illustrate a case where parameter parsing leads to non-intuitive results.
