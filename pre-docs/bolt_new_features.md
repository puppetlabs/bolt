# New features

New features added to Bolt in the 0.x release series. 

## Show command results include path to module content \(0.24.0\)

`bolt plan show <plan>` and `bolt task show <task>` include the path to the module content. \([BOLT-841](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-841)\)

## Support for control repo as boltdir \(0.24.0\)

Bolt now reads bolt.yaml in a current or parent directory, and interprets it as the location of a Boltdir for finding config such as inventory and facts. This enables running Bolt within common control repo layouts by adding bolt.yaml. \([BOLT-816](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-816)\)

## Updates to Ruby and OpenSSL \(0.24.0\)

Bolt packages ship with Ruby 2.5.1 and OpenSSL 1.1.0. \([BOLT-789](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-789)\)

## Support for different input methods for implementations \(0.24.0\)

Bolt now reads and prefers input methods defined for a particular implementation of a task. \([BOLT-758](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-758)\)

## Support for unknown keys in task metadata \(0.24.0\)

Bolt ignores unknown keys in task metadata instead of producing an error. This allows Bolt to continue working with tasks that may use future optional features in metadata. \([BOLT-752](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-752)\)

## Breaking change: modulepath includes paths relative to the Boltdir \(0.23.0\)

When you include relative paths \(such as "modules" or "site"\) in the modulepath setting specified in the config file, they are based on the Boltdir rather than the current working directory. As a result, you can use Boltdir between multiple users. \([BOLT-719](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-719)\)

## Site added to end of default modulepath \(0.23.0\)

The Bolt default modulepath is now `Boltdir/modules:Boltdir/site`. This provides a directory that you can manage from a Puppetfile with `bolt puppetfile install` \(Boltdir/modules\), as well as a directory that can contain custom content that you do not manage from a Puppetfile \(Boltdir/site\). \([BOLT-766](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-766)\)

## Define sensitive parameters \(0.22.0\)

You can define parameters as sensitive, for example, passwords and API keys. These values are masked when they appear in logs and API responses. To view them set the log file to `level: debug`. For more information, see [writing\_tasks.md\#title-1536170911349](writing_tasks.md#title-1536170911349) \([BOLT-794](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-794)\)

## Support added for tilde character \(~\) \(0.22.0\)

You can use the tilde character \(~\) to indicate your home directory when you reference a nodes file. For example, `--nodes @~/hosts.csv`. \([BOLT-813](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-813)\)

## Improved support for apply command \(0.21.8\)

The following enhancements have been made to the Bolt`apply` command:

-   `apply` supports resource overrides, such as `File['/tmp/foo'] { mode => '0644' }` \([BOLT-775](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-775)\)

-   `apply` works with older releases of Puppet 4.10. \([BOLT-776](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-776)\)

-   The `apply_prep` function supports SLES 11 and 12. \([BOLT-797](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-797)\)


## Logging messages added to run\_plan function \(0.21.7\)

The `run_plan`function logs when a plan or sub-plan starts and finishes. This matches the behavior of other run functions. \([BOLT-797](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-797)\)

## Install a puppet-agent \(0.21.6\)

Bolt includes a version of the puppet\_agent module with tasks to install the puppet-agent package on Windows, macOS, and many Linux variants. The `apply_prep` function makes use of this task to install Puppet. \([BOLT-615](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-615)\)

## Call Bolt from Ruby API \(0.21.6\)

New helpers have been added to the BoltSpec that allow you to call Bolt from Ruby and better test module code from Bolt. \([BOLT-717](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-717)\)

## Apply blocks of Puppet code to remote nodes \(0.21.6\)

Use Bolt to apply blocks of Puppet code \(manifest blocks\) to remote nodes. Similar to the `puppet apply` command, which applies a standalone Puppet manifest to a local system, the Bolt`apply` command embeds Puppet code in a plan, compiles a catalog and then applies that catalog on a target. For more information, see [Applying manifest blocks](applying_manifest_blocks.md#). \([BOLT-565](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-565)\)

## Download and install modules \(0.21.4\)

Use  Bolt to download and install modules from the Puppet Forge or a Git repository. For instructions, see [Set up Bolt to download and install modules](installing_tasks_from_the_forge.md#). \([BOLT-523](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-523)\)

## bolt\_spec plan helpers added to Bolt gem \(0.21.4\)

Rspec helpers for unit testing plans ship with the Bolt gem. \([BOLT-613](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-613)\)

## Support added for Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) version 1.2 \(0.21.3\)

Bolt uses the protocol TLS 1.2 to connect to Puppet orchestrator \(the PCP transport\). This enables you to work with Bolt in Puppet Enterprise deployments that have disabled TLS 1.0. \([BOLT-686](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-686)\)

## Command completion for bash shell available \(0.21.3\)

## Trace option added to exceptions \(0.21.1\)

Bolt supports a `--trace` option which prints a backtrace or list of calls after an exception This helps locate where errors have occurred. \([BOLT-620](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-620)\)

## Support for Kerberos authentication \(0.21.1\)

Bolt supports Kerberos authentication for SSH connections out-of-the-box when installed using the `puppet-bolt` package. \([BOLT-617](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-617)\)

For more information, see [Configuring Bolt](configuring_bolt.md). \([BOLT-503](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-503)\)

## Output format added to analytics data collection \(0.21.0\)
