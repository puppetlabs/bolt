# Bolt command options

Bolt commands can accept several command line options, some of which are
required to run certain bolt commands.

You must specify target nodes for all bolt commands. Task commands, such as
`bolt run task` and `bolt run plan`, require the `--modules` flag to specify the
location of the task or plan module on the workstation you are running the
command from.


## Specifying nodes

You must specify the target nodes that you want to execute bolt commands on.

For most bolt commands, specify the target nodes with the `--nodes` flag when you
run the command, such as `--nodes mercury`. For plans, the `--nodes` flag will
be mapped to the `nodes` parameter if the plan exposes one.

When targeting machines with the `--nodes` flag, you may specify the transport
either in the node url for each host, such as `--nodes
winrm://mywindowsnode.mydomain`, or set a default transport for the operation
with the `--transport` option. If you do not specify a transport it will
default to `ssh`.

To specify multiple nodes with the `--nodes` flag, use a comma-separated list of
nodes, such as `--nodes neptune,saturn,mars`.

Alternatively, you can use brace expansion on the command line to generate a
node list, specify a node list from a file, or pass a node list on stdin.

To generate a node list with brace expansion, specify the node list with an
equals sign (`=`), such as `--nodes=web{1,2}`.

For example, this command:

```
 bolt command run --nodes={web{5,6,7},elasticsearch{1,2,3}.subdomain}.mydomain.edu
```
runs Bolt on the following hosts:
- elasticsearch1.subdomain.mydomain.edu
- elasticsearch2.subdomain.mydomain.edu
- elasticsearch3.subdomain.mydomain.edu
- web5.mydomain.edu
- web6.mydomain.edu
- web7.mydomain.edu

To pass nodes to Bolt in a file, pass the file name and relative location with
the `--nodes` flag and an `@` symbol: `bolt command run --nodes @nodes.txt`

To pass nodes on `stdin`, on the command line, use a command to generate a node
list, and pipe the result to Bolt with `-` after `--nodes` : `<COMMAND> | bolt command run --nodes -` For
example, if you have a node list in a text file, you might run `cat nodes.txt |
bolt command run --nodes -`


### Specifying nodes from an inventory file

To specify nodes from an inventory file, reference nodes by node name, a glob
matching names in the file, or the name of a group of nodes.

For the inventory file example below, the command `--nodes
elastic_search,web_app` matches all nodes in both groups, `elastic_search` and
`web_app`. And `--nodes 'elasticsearch*'` references all the nodes that start with
elasticsearch.


```
groups:
  - name: elastic_search
    nodes:
      - elasticsearch1.subdomain.mydomain.edu
      - elasticsearch2.subdomain.mydomain.edu
      - elasticsearch3.subdomain.mydomain.edu
  - name: web_app
    nodes:
      - web5.mydomain.edu
      - web6.mydomain.edu
      - web7.mydomain.edu
```


### Setting a default transport

To set a default transport protocol, pass it with the command with the `--transport` option.

Pass the `--transport` option after the nodes list, such as `--nodes win1 --transport winrm`

This sets the transport protocol as the default for this command. If you set
this option when running a plan, it is treated as the default transport for the
entire plan run. Any nodes passed with transports in their url or transports
configured in inventory will not use this default.

This is useful on Windows, so that you do not have to include the winrm
transport for each node. To override the default transport, specify the
protocol on a per-host basis, such as `bolt command run facter --nodes
win1,ssh://linux --transport winrm`

If `localhost` is passed to `--nodes` when invoking Bolt on a non-windows OS the `local` transport is used automatically. This behaviour can be avoided by prepending the target with the desired transport (ex: `ssh://localhost`).


## Specifying connection credentials

To run bolt commands on target nodes that require a username and password, pass
credentials as options on the command line.

Bolt connects to remote nodes with either SSH or WinRM. You can manage SSH
connections with an SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) on your workstation,
or you can specify the username and password on the command line.

WinRM connections always require you to pass the username and password with the
bolt command. For example, this command targets a WinRM node:

```
bolt command run 'gpupdate /force' --nodes winrm://pluto --user Administrator --password <PASSWORD>
```
To have Bolt securely prompt for a password, use the `--password` or `-p` flag
without supplying any value. Bolt will prompt for the password, so that the
password does not appear in a process listing or on the console.


## Specifying the module path

When executing tasks or plans, you must specify the `--modulepath` option as
the directory containing the task modules.

Specify this option in the format `--modulepath </PATH/TO/MODULE>`. This path
should be only the path the modules directory, such as `~/modules`. Do not
specify the module name in this path, as the name is already specified as part
of the task or plan name.

To specify multiple module directories to search for modules, separate the paths with a semicolon
(`;`) on Windows or a colon (`:`) on all other platforms.


## Bolt command reference
