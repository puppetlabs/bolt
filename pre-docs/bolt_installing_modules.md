# Installing modules

Tasks and plans are packaged in Puppet modules, so you can install them as you would any module and manage them with a Puppetfile.Â 

## Packaged modules

Bolt is packaged with a collection of useful modules to support common workflows.

This list of packaged modules is available in a [Puppetfile](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/Puppetfile) in the Bolt repository. The modules and supporting documentation are publicly available on the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/).

**Note:** If you installed Bolt as a Ruby Gem, make sure you have installed these core modules.

### Modules with useful task and plan content

-   [package](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/package): Install, uninstall, update, and check the status of packages.
-   [service](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/service): Manage and inspect the state of services.
-   [puppet_conf](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_conf): Inspect and change the configuration options in the `puppet.conf` file.
-   [facts](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/facts): Retrieve facts from specified nodes.
-   [puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent): Install Puppet Agent package.
-   [reboot](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot): Manage system reboots.


### Core Puppet providers

-   [scheduled_task](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/scheduled_task): Provider capable of using the Version 2 Windows API for task management.
-   [sshkeys_core](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/sshkeys_core): Manage `SSH`, `authorized_keys`, and `ssh_known_hosts` files.
-   [zfs_core](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/zfs_core): Manage `zfs` and `zpool` resources.
-   [cron_core](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/cron_core): Install and manage `cron` resources.
-   [mount_core](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mount_core): Manage mounted filesystems and mount tables.

-   [zone_core](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/zone_core): Manage Solaris zone resources.


### Bolt-specific modules that are not available on the Forge

-   [aggregate](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/tree/master/modules/aggregate): Aggregate task, script or command results.
-   [canary](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/tree/master/modules/canary): Run action against a small number of nodes and only if it succeeds will it run on the rest.
-   [puppetdb_fact](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/tree/master/modules/puppetdb_fact): Collect facts for the specified nodes from the configured PuppetDB connection and stores the collected facts on the targets.

**Tip:** To override a packaged module with another version, download the version you want and configure your modulepath to point to it.

### Modules that contain helper code for writing your own tasks

-   [ruby_task_helper](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ruby_task_helper): A helper for writing tasks in Ruby.
-   [python_task_helper](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/python_task_helper): A helper for writing tasks in Python.

**Tip:** To override a packaged module with another version, download the version you want and configure your modulepath to point to it.

## Configure Bolt to download and install modules

Before you can use Bolt to install modules, you must first create a Puppetfile. A Puppetfile is a formatted text file that contains a list of modules and their versions. It can include modules from the Forge or a Git repository.

For modules that require Ruby Gems, see [Install Gems with Bolt packages](bolt_installing.md#)

For more details about specifying modules in a Puppetfile, see the [Puppetfile documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/puppetfile.html).

1.  Create a file named Puppetfile and store it in the [Bolt project directory](bolt_project_directories.md#).
1.  Open the Puppetfile in a text editor and add the modules and versions that you want to install. If the modules have dependencies, list those as well.
    ```
    # Modules from the Puppet Forge.
    mod 'puppetlabs-apache', '4.1.0'
    mod 'puppetlabs-postgresql', '5.12.0'
    mod 'puppetlabs-puppet_conf', '0.3.0'
    mod 'puppetlabs-facts', '0.3.1'
    
    # Modules from a Git repository.
    mod 'puppetlabs-haproxy', git: 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy.git', ref: 'master'
    ```
1.  Add any task or plan modules stored locally in `modules/` to the list. If these modules are not listed in the Puppetfile, they are deleted.
    ```
    mod 'my_awesome_module', local: true
    ```
    Install any modules that you don't want to manage with the Puppetfile to a different subdirectory. Conventionally, `site-modules` is used for this purpose and is included on the default `modulepath`.
1.  From a terminal, install the modules listed in the Puppetfile: `bolt puppetfile install`. Bolt installs modules to the first directory in the modulepath setting. By default, this is the `modules/` subdirectory inside the Bolt project directory. To override this location, update the modulepath setting in the Bolt config file.
