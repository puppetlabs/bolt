# Generating inventory files

Use the `bolt-inventory-pdb` script to generate inventory files based on PuppetDB queries.

## Usage

The `bolt-inventory-pdb` script accepts a single argument: the path of the source file used to generate the inventory file. It queries PuppetDB to resolve node lists and prints inventory yaml output to stdout or to a file you specify with the `-o` flag.

```
bolt-inventory-pdb pdb.yaml -o ~/.puppetlabs/bolt/inventory.yaml
```

For full usage information, type `bolt-inventory-pdb --help`.

## Configuration

The `bolt-inventory-pdb` script uses the configuration file `puppetdb.conf`, which is stored at:

-    **\*nix systems** `$HOME/.puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf` 

-    **Windows** `%USERPROFILE%\.puppetlabs\client-tools\puppetdb.conf` 


**Note:** The precedence used to load puppetdb config is:

1.   `configfile` \(optionally specified with `--configfile`\)
2.   `$HOME/.puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf` 
3.   `/etc/puppetlabs/client-tools/puppetdb.conf` \(Windows: `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\client-tools\puppetdb.conf`\)

 `bolt-inventory-pdb` requires the following file settings:

-    `--token-file` The path to the PE Authorization token.

-    `--cacert` The path for the certification authority \(CA\) certificate.

    \*nix systems - /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem

    Windows - C:\\ProgramData\\PuppetLabs\\puppet\\etc\\ssl\\certs\\ca.pem

-    `--url` The URL of your PuppetDB server.


```
$ bolt-inventory-pdb pdb.yaml -o myfile.yaml --token-file ~/mytoken --cacert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem --url  https://<PUPPETDB_HOST>:8081
```

## File format

The `bolt-inventory-pdb` tool generates an inventory file from a source yaml file. This file has the same format as the inventory file except instead of nodes keys it has query keys. The query should be a PuppetDB query in either [Puppet Query Language \(PQL\)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/5.2/api/query/v4/pql.html) or AST syntax. When `bolt-inventory-pdb` runs it makes queries against PuppetDB and creates a nodes item for each group. This is an example of a file that adds all nodes to the top-level group, creates a Windows group configured to use the WinRM transport and a basil group for nodes with basil in the certname.

```
query: "nodes[certname] {}"
groups:
- name: windows
query: "inventory[certname] { facts.osfamily = 'windows' }"
config:
transport: winrm
- name: basil
query: "nodes[certname] { certname ~ '^basil' }"
```
