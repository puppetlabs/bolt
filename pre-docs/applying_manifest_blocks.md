# Applying manifest blocks

Within a plan, you can use Bolt to apply blocks of Puppet code \(manifest blocks\) to remote nodes. 

Similar to the `puppet apply` command, which applies a standalone Puppet manifest to a local system, the Bolt `apply` command leverages manifest blocks to pass code to remote nodes from the command line. You can create manifest blocks that use existing content from the Forge, or mix declarative resource configuration via manifest blocks with procedural orchestration and action in a plan. Most features of the Puppet language are available in a manifest block: classes, custom resource types, and functions. Exceptions are noted.

**Tip:** If you installed Bolt as a Ruby Gem, make sure you have installed the core modules required to use the `puppet apply` command. These modules are listed in the [Bolt GitHub repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/Puppetfile)and you can install them using a Puppetfile.

## How manifest blocks are applied

When you run a plan that contains a manifest block, the `apply_prep` function installs the packages necessary to run the Bolt `apply` command.

The `apply_prep` function identifies the nodes that do not have Puppet agents and runs the `puppet_agent::install` task \(from the [puppet\_agent module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppet_agent)\). It also copies over custom facts from Bolt's modulepath and runs `facter` on the target nodes.

Behind the scenes, Bolt compiles the code in your manifest block \(the code wrapped in curly braces that follows the `apply` function\) into a catalog. Code is compiled in descending order of precedence:

-    `Facts` gathered from the targets or set in your inventory
-   Local variables in the plan, such as `$site_content` 
-    `Vars` set in your inventory

Like the code compiled with the `puppet apply` function, all the variables are generated. As a result, you can resuse code between Bolt and Puppet. It then copies custom module content from the Bolt modulepath to the target nodes and applies the catalog using Puppet.

After the catalog compiles and is executed successfully on all targets, `apply` returns the reports generated by applying the catalog on each node.

### Options

The `apply` action supports common metaparameters available to other Bolt functions.

```
apply(Boltlib::TargetSpec $targets, Optional[Hash[String[1], Any]] $options)
```

Returns: `ResultSet` containing ApplyResult.

-   `_catch_errors => true` returns a `ResultSet` including failed results, rather than failing the plan.

-   `_noop => true` applies the manifest block in Puppet no-operation mode, returning a report of the changes it would make, but takes no action.

-   `_run_as => <user>`applies the manifest block as the specified user \(on transports that support it\).


### Return Value of Apply Action

The apply action returns a `ResultSet` with an `ApplyResult` object for each target.

### Configuring Concurrency

Each target requires a separate catalog be compiled with its unique facts and vars.

The apply action compiles and applies catalogs in parallel on the Bolt host. Concurrency of catalog compilation is controlled by a `compile-concurrency` config option. This option is limited to twice the number of threads your CPU can run concurrently, while catalog application uses the Bolt default thread pool controlled by the `concurrency` option.

## Using Hiera data in a manifest block

Use Hiera to separate configuration from context-specific data, where context may be fact-based or the name of a target.

**Note:** Only Hiera version 5 is supported in Bolt.

Hiera is a built-in key-value configuration data lookup system, used for separating data from Puppet code. You use Hiera data to implicitly override default class parameters. You can also explicitly lookup data from Hiera via lookup, for example:

```
plan do_thing() {
  apply('localhost') {
    notice("Some data in Hiera: ${lookup('mydata')}")
  }
}
```

Manifest block compilation can access Hiera data that you add to your Bolt config. The default location for Hiera config is `$BOLTDIR/hiera.yaml`; you can change this with the `hiera-config`key in a Bolt config file.

Following the Hiera 5 convention, the default data dir is relative to `hiera.yaml` at `$BOLTDIR/data`. For config file examples, see [Configuring Hiera](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.0/hiera_config_yaml_5.html).

If a custom data provider is used \(such as `hiera-eyaml`, which allows you to encrypt your data\) the gem dependencies must be available to Bolt. If using `puppet-bolt` packages and installing `hiera-eyaml`

-   on Windows, run `"C:/Program Files/Puppet Labs/Bolt/bin/gem.bat" install hiera-eyaml`

-   on other platforms, run `/opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/gem install hiera-eyaml`


## Available plan functions

In addition to the standard Puppet functions available to a catalog, such as `lookup`, you can use the following Bolt functions in a manifest block.

-    [puppetdb\_query](plan_functions.md#) 

-    [puppetdb\_facts](plan_functions.md#) 

-    [get\_targets](plan_functions.md#) 

-    [facts](plan_functions.md#) 

-    [vars](plan_functions.md#) 


## Manifest block limitations

Review what functionality is not available for use in manifest block.

Exported resources are not supported in manifest blocks. You should pass exported resources directly instead of exporting and collecting them from PuppetDB. If you need to interact with resources managed during a normal run, use [puppetdb\_query](plan_functions.md#).

In addition, there are some top level variables that exist in normal catalog compilation that are not included during manifest block compilation:

-   `$server_facts`

-   master variables like `$servername`

-   $`environment`


If needed you can set these from a target's `vars`, but they don't have obvious defaults in Bolt.

## Create a sample manifest for nginx on Linux

Create a manifest to set up a web server with nginx and run it as a plan.

Save this module in the Bolt default Boltdir \(`~/.puppetlabs/bolt`\).

1.  Go to `~/.puppetlabs/bolt/modules`
2.   Create a module. 
    -   If you use the Puppet Development Kit: `pdk new module profiles` and add a `plans` directory 
    -   Otherwise create `~/.puppetlabs/bolt/modules/profiles/plans`
3.  Add the following code to the manifest: `profiles/plans/nginx_install.pp` 

    ```
    plan profiles::nginx_install(
         TargetSpec $nodes,
         String $site_content = 'hello!',
       ) {
    
         # Install the puppet-agent package if Puppet is not detected.
         # Copy over custom facts from the Bolt modulepath.
         # Run the `facter` command line tool to gather node information.
         $nodes.apply_prep
    
         # Compile the manifest block into a catalog
         apply($nodes) {
           if($facts['os']['family'] == 'redhat') {
             package { 'epel-release':
               ensure => present,
               before => Package['nginx'],
             }
             $html_dir = '/usr/share/nginx/html'
           } else {
             $html_dir = '/var/www/html'
           }
    
           package {'nginx':
             ensure => present,
           }
    
           file {"${html_dir}/index.html":
             content => $site_content,
             ensure  => file,
           }
    
           service {'nginx':
             ensure  => 'running',
             enable  => 'true',
             require => Package['nginx']
           }
         }
       }
    ```

4.  Run the plan on a target node: `bolt plan run profiles::nginx_install --nodes <NODE NAME>`.
5.  From a web browser, navigate to `<NODE NAME>`. 

    The page displays the text **hello!**


**Tip:** For more complex web server deployments, consider adding the [puppet-nginx](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nginx) module.
