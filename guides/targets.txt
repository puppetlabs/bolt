    targets

DESCRIPTION
    A target is a device that Bolt connects to and runs actions on. Targets can
    be physical, such as servers, or virtual, such as containers or virtual
    machines.

    Several of Bolt's commands connect to targets and run actions on them.
    These commands require a target or targets to run on. You can specify
    targets to a command using one of the following command-line options:

    *nix options                Powershell options
     -t, --targets TARGETS      -T, -Targets  TARGETS
     -q, --query   QUERY        -Q, -Query    QUERY
         --rerun   FILTER       -Rerun        FILTER

    The 'targets' option accepts a comma-separated list of target URIs or group
    names, or can read a target list from an input file '@<file>' or stdin '-'.
    URIs can be specified with the format [protocol://][user@]host[:port]. To
    learn more about available protocols and their defaults, run 'bolt guide
    transports'.

    Typically, targets and their configuration and data are listed in a
    project's inventory file. For more information about inventory files,
    see 'bolt guide inventory'.
