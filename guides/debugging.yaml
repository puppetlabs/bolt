    When Bolt isn't behaving as expected, there are a few helpful commands and
    logs that can help identify common issues. The first place to look is in
    `<PROJECT>/bolt-debug.log`, which contains debug-level logs from the last Bolt
    run. This log file includes where the Bolt project was loaded from, the
    location of any configuration or inventory files that were loaded, and the
    modulepath that modules were loaded from.

    If you're having issues with loading targets or target configuration, you
    can see the list of resolved Bolt target names by running `bolt inventory
    show` on *nix systems or `Get-BoltInventory` in PowerShell. To see the
    resolved configuration for each target, run the command with the `--detail` or
    `-Detail` options.

    Lastly, if you're having trouble loading Bolt content you can use `bolt
    module show` on *nix systems or `Get-BoltModule` in PowerShell to see the list
    of loaded modules, including where they were loaded from. You can also use
    `bolt task show` or `Get-BoltTask` to list loaded tasks, and `bolt plan show`
    or `Get-BoltPlan` to list loaded plans.
