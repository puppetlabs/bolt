    Modules are shareable, reusable packages of Puppet content. They can include
    tasks, plans, functions, and other types of content that you can use in your
    project. You can download and install modules to your project from the
    Puppet Forge or write your own modules. Bolt also ships with several helpful
    modules pre-installed that are available to all of your projects.

    Bolt makes it easy to manage the modules that your project depends on. You
    can use Bolt commands to install a project's modules, add new modules to a
    project, and view the modules that are available to the project.
    
    To learn more about managing modules in a project, see the documentation.
    To learn how modules are loaded by Bolt, see the 'modulepath' guide.
