    The modulepath is an ordered list of directories that Bolt loads modules
    from. When Bolt runs a command, it automatically loads modules from the
    modulepath.
    
    While Bolt has a default modulepath, you can also configure your own
    modulepath, which can include directories within the project or directories
    elsewhere on your system. Regardless of whether your project uses a default
    or configured modulepath, Bolt automatically adds directories to the
    modulepath. This includes modules containing core Bolt content, which is
    added to the beginning of the modulepath, and bundled content, which is
    added to the end of the modulepath.

    Modules loaded from a directory listed earlier in the modulepath take
    precedence over modules with the same name loaded from a directory later in
    the modulepath. Bolt will not warn or error when two modules share a name
    and instead will ignore modules with a lower precedence.

    To learn more about modules, see the 'module' guide.
