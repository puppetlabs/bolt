DESCRIPTION
    Bolt prints messages both to the console and to log files. Messages can
    either come from Bolt's 'outputter', which logs user-facing messages like
    progress and results, or from the 'logger', which logs warnings, errors, and
    log-structured output to log files. Both of these message streams are
    configurable.

    By default, Bolt logs to the console at 'warn' level and writes a log file to
    '<project>/bolt-debug.log' at 'debug' level. Unless you are running a plan,
    Bolt runs in verbose mode by default.

    To learn more about projects, see the 'project' guide.
