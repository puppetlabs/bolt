# ðŸ§ª Experimental features

Most larger Bolt features are released initially in an experimental or unstable
state. This allows the Bolt team to gather feedback from real users quickly
while iterating on new functionality. Almost all experimental features are
eventually stabilized in future releases. While a feature is experimental, its
API might change, requiring the user to update their code or configuration. The
Bolt team attempts to make these changes painless by providing useful warnings
around breaking behavior where possible.

## Configuration policies and the `policy` command

This feature was introduced in [Bolt 3.21.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-3210-2021-12-16). 

### What are policies?

Configuration policies are public Puppet classes stored in the `manifests/`
directory of modules on the modulepath. Just like other Puppet code, you can
apply policies directly to one or more targets.

### Policies in a Bolt project's configuration file

The project configuration file, `bolt-project.yaml`, supports a `policies` key
which lists the policies available to a project. A Puppet class becomes a policy
when you list it under the `policies` key. If you do not configure the
`policies` key, no policies will be available for Bolt to apply.

You can manually add policies to the `policies` key in `bolt-project.yaml`, or
manage policies using the Bolt command line. The `policies` key supports glob
patterns for easily listing multiple policies. For example, `myproject::*`
includes both the `myproject::admin` and `myproject::sshkeys` policies.

The following configuration file makes the `myproject::admin` and
`myproject::sshkeys` policies available to the project:
```
---
# bolt-project.yaml
name: myproject
policies:
- myproject::admin
- myproject::sshkeys
```

### Creating new policies 

You can use Bolt to create a new policy in your project and add it to the
`policies` key in your project configuration. For example, to create a new
project-level policy named `myproject::user`, run:

* _*nix shell command_
  ```
  bolt policy new myproject::user
  ```

* _PowerShell cmdlet_
  ```
  New-BoltPolicy -Name myproject::user
  ```

Bolt creates an empty class in the project's `manifests/` directory that you can
populate with code. Policy names must follow [class naming
conventions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_reserved.html#classes-and-defined-resource-type-names).


Example output:
```
Created policy 'myproject::user' at '/Users/puppet.user/myproject/manifests/user.pp'
```

Create policies manually by:

1. Adding the file to a module's or project's `manifests/` directory.
2. Modifying the project's `bolt-project.yaml` to include the policy in the
   `policies` key.

### Listing available policies

You can list available policies for the project:

* _*nix shell command_ 
  ```
  bolt policy show 
  ```

* _PowerShell cmdlet_ 
  ``` 
  Get-BoltPolicy 
  ```

Example output:
```
Policies
  myproject::admin
  myproject::sshkeys

Modulepath
  /Users/puppet.user/myproject/modules:/Users/puppet.user/myproject/.modules
```

### Applying policies to targets

Applying policies is similar to [applying Puppet
code](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/applying_manifest_blocks.html), with
the addition that you can apply one or more policies at a time. The Bolt
commands for applying policies accept a single policy name or a comma-separated
list of policy names to apply to a list of one or more targets. 

For example, to apply both `myproject::admin` and `myproject::sshkeys` policies
to a target:

* _*nix shell command_
  ```
  bolt policy apply myproject::admin,myproject::sshkeys -t mytarget                                
  ```

* _PowerShell cmdlet_
  ```
  Invoke-BoltPolicy -Name myproject::admin,myproject::sshkeys -Targets mytarget
  ```

Example output:
```
Starting: install puppet and gather facts on mytarget
Finished: install puppet and gather facts with 0 failures in 6.51 sec
Starting: apply catalog on mytarget
Started on mytarget...
Finished on mytarget:
  changed: 1, failed: 0, unchanged: 0 skipped: 0, noop: 0
Finished: apply catalog with 0 failures in 8.59 sec
Successful on 1 target: mytarget
Ran on 1 target in 15.2 sec
```

Before applying policies, Bolt uses the `apply_prep` function to collect facts and
ensure that the puppet-agent package is available on each target. For more
information on how Bolt uses `apply_prep`, see [Applying manifest
blocks](applying_manifest_blocks.md#applying-manifest-blocks-from-a-puppet-plan).
Bolt creates a single line of Puppet code to compile and apply to the provided
targets. This line of code includes the syntax `include <POLICIES>` and Bolt
logs the line at the debug level.

## `run_container` plan step

This feature was introduced in [Bolt 3.5.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-350-2021-3-29).

Currently available as a Puppet plan function, `run_container()` runs a provided image and
returns the `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exit_code` for that image. The function supports several
options, including `cmd` to specify a command to run in the container, `volumes` to mount volumes to
the container, and `ports` to publish ports from the container on the host. You can see all the
supported options in the [plan function documentation](plan_functions.md#run_container).

The function runs the container on the Bolt controller, not on remote targets. This function is
supported on both \*nix and Windows systems. 

This plan clones the [Relay repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay), builds the Go binary in a
container that has all the dependencies in it, and installs the binary to a local path.

```
plan bolt (
  TargetSpec $targets = 'localhost'
) {
  $relay_path = '/tmp/relay'
  run_command("git clone git@github.com:puppetlabs/relay.git ${$relay_path}", 'localhost')
  run_container('golang', 'volumes' => { $relay_path => '/relay' },
                'workdir' => '/relay',
                'rm' => true,
                'cmd' => "/bin/sh -c \"./scripts/generate && ./scripts/build\"")
  run_command("mv ${$relay_path}/bin/* /usr/bin", 'localhost')
}
```

## Podman support

Bolt now has experimental support for [Podman](https://podman.io/), a daemonless container engine.
The Podman transport supports connecting to containers managed by Podman on the local system.
The Podman transport accepts many of the same configuration options as the Docker transport. You can
see the full list of supported configuration options [on the transport reference
page](bolt_transports_reference.md). The Podman transport doesn't support the `service-url`
configuration options as the transport doesn't support remote connections. If this is a feature
you're interested in, let us know [in Slack](https://slack.puppet.com) or submit a [Github
issue](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues).

The example inventory file below demonstrates connecting to a Podman container target named
`postgres_db`.

```
targets:
  - uri: podman://postgres_db
    config:
      podman:
        tmpdir: /root/tmp
```

## Streaming output

This feature was introduced in [Bolt 3.2.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-320-2021-3-08).

You can set the new `stream` output option in `bolt-project.yaml` or `bolt-defaults.yaml`, or
specify the option on the command line as `--stream`. Bolt streams results back to the console as
they are received, with the target's safe name (the URI without the password included) and the
stream (either 'out' or 'err') appended to the message, like so:
```
Started on docker://puppet_6_node...
Started on docker://puppet_7_node...
[docker://puppet_7_node] out: Hello!
[docker://puppet_6_node] out: Hello!
Finished on docker://puppet_7_node:
  Hello!
Finished on docker://puppet_6_node:
  Hello!
```

As you can see, when you configure output to stream, Bolt may print to the console twice:
once as the actions are running, and again after Bolt prints the results. You can prevent
Bolt from printing the results once the action has completed by specifying the `--no-verbose`
command-line option.

## LXD Transport

This feature was introduced in [Bolt 3.2.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-320-2021-3-08).

The LXD transport supports connecting to Linux containers on the local system. Similar to the Docker
transport, the LXD transport accepts the name of the container as the URI, and connects to the
container by shelling out to the `lxc` command. The example inventory file below demonstrates
connecting to a Linux container target named `ubuntuone`.

```
targets:
  - uri: lxd://ubuntuone
    config:
      lxd:
        tmpdir: /root/tmp
```

## Plugin caching

This feature was introduced in [Bolt
2.37.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-2370-2020-12-07).

Bolt supports the use of plugins to dynamically load information during a Bolt run and change how
Bolt executes certain actions. Bolt also loads all configuration plugins for most Bolt commands, and
all inventory plugins for any action that requires the inventory, even if the action only uses a
subset of targets from the inventory. Plugins can sometimes take a long time to execute, and several
plugin invocations can add quite a bit of start up time to any Bolt command regardless of whether it
uses the plugin results.

To mitigate the time it takes for Bolt to load plugins, we've introduced plugin caching. Plugin
caching is enabled by configuring a Time to Live (TTL) for the cache, either by setting a default
TTL for all plugins with the `plugin-cache` project configuration option or by setting `ttl` under
the `_cache` option for an individual plugin invocation. The TTL is always in seconds. Bolt caches
plugin results inside the Bolt project, and removes all expired cache entries whenever it
uses a cache result. This prevents cache entries from getting orphaned and never removed. Bolt
identifies a cache result based on a hash (delightfully named 'bubblebabble') of the entire plugin
invocation, minus the `_cache` key. If any element of the plugin invocation changes, Bolt reloads
the plugin and updates the cache.

You can set `ttl` to 0 to disable caching for a particular plugin. Caching is disabled by default,
so this is mostly useful if you have a default cache `ttl` configured under `plugin-cache` in your
`bolt-project.yaml` or `bolt-defaults.yaml` and want to disable caching for individual plugin
invocations.

> **NOTE**: Plugin results are currently cached in plaintext. Encrypted caching is planned for a
future release.

Users can clear all cache entries using the `--clear-cache` or `-ClearCache` command-line option
with any Bolt command.

This inventory sets a TTL of 1 hour, or 3600 seconds, for the PuppetDB plugin:
```
targets:
  - _plugin: puppetdb
    _cache:
      ttl: 3600
    query: "inventory[certname] { facts.osfamily = 'RedHat' }"
    target_mapping:
      name: certname
```

This config file sets a default TTL of 30 minutes, or 1800 seconds, for all plugins:
```
plugin-cache:
  ttl: 1800
```

> **NOTE**: The same cache and cache configuration is used for the `resolve_reference()` plan
function.

## Parallelism in Bolt plans

The `parallelize()` plan function was introduced in [Bolt
2.35.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-2350-2020-11-16).
The `background()` and `wait()` plan functions were introduced in [Bolt 3.9.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-390-2021-05-25).

For context, Bolt plan functions have always run concurrently across targets - that is, if a
function takes a list of targets and operates on them, the function runs that step on each target in
parallel. For example, the following plan runs `hostname` on all targets at the same time, waits for
all targets to finish, and then runs `whoami` on all targets at the same time. 

```
# $targets = target1,target2,target3
plan myplan(TargetSpec $targets) {
  run_command('hostname', $targets)
  run_command('whoami', $targets)
}
```

In the example above, `target3` has to wait for `hostname` to finish on `target1` and `target2`
before it can run `whoami`.

While useful, this form of parallelism is limited. Bolt plans have a few methods that allow a block
of plan steps to execute in the background while other parts of the plan execute in parallel:
* The `background` plan function begins executing a block of code in parellel with the main plan
  and other backgrounded code blocks. This is great for use cases where you want to start a process
  and don't care about the results, or don't need the results until much later in the plan. This
  function returns a [Future](bolt_types_reference.md#Future) object so that the result can be
  accessed later in the plan.
* The `wait` function is a sister to `background`. It accepts a Future or array of Futures and
  blocks until they are finished, optionally with a timeout, then returns the results.
* The `parallelize` function accepts an array and a block of plan steps, and then creates a Future
  for each block in the array. It blocks until all the Futures have finished.

These two function invocations are equivalent:
```
parallelize(['./file1', './file2']) |$file| {
  file_upload($file, '/home/user/', $targets)
  ...
}

# Is equivalent to
['./file1', './file2'].map |$file| {
  background() || {
    file_upload($file,...)
    ...
  }
}.wait
```

### `background()` and `wait()` plan functions

The `background()` plan function creates a new Future object, and begins running the code block in
the background in parallel with the main plan and other backgrounded code blocks. The function
accepts an optional name for the Future to make log messages easier to follow.

The code block has access to all existing variables when it's created, and has its own scope, so any
new variables are not accessible outside the code block.

Plans will return normally even when they have Futures running in the background, and those
Futures will continue to execute in parallel. However, Bolt itself will not exit until all Futures
have completed in order to ensure that all work is finished. Any errors raised after the calling
plan has finished will be logged at warn level for visibility.

The `wait()` plan function accepts either a single Future object, an array of Futures, or no
Futures. If not provided any Futures, the function implicitly waits for all Futures created up
to that point in the calling plan. The `wait()` function does not wait on any Futures created
in subplans, even if the subplan is called inside a `background()` block. If you want a plan to wait
on a Future object created in a subplan then you must call `wait()` in the subplan directly, or
return Future objects to the calling plan to be explicitly passed to `wait()`.

For example, the following plan runs the code block with three `run_command()` calls on
the provided targets in the background, then executes a task in parallel. Once the task has
finished, the commands may still be running in the background. Another task is kicked off in the
background. Then the backgrounded commands and tasks are waited on before continuing.

```
# $targets = target1,target2,target3
plan myplan(TargetSpec $targets) {
  $binary_future = background("Run mycoolbinary") || {
    # These commands execute sequentially per target. Bolt connects to the targets in 
    # parallel, but waits for the cp command to finish before running chmod
    run_command("cp /home/user/Downloads/mycoolbinary /home/user/bin", $targets)
    run_command("chmod +x /home/user/bin/mycoolbinary", $targets)
    run_command("mycoolbinary", $targets)
  }

  # This task runs while the commands above are running
  run_task("mytask", $targets)
  
  # Once the task 'mytask' has finished, start more commands in the background
  $status_future = background("Check service status") || {
    $r = run_command("systemctl status myservice", $targets)
    out::message($r)
  }

  # This is equivalent to wait() in this plan
  wait([$binary_future, $status_future])
}
```

The function blocks until the Futures finish, with an optional timeout. If provided a timeout,
unfinished Futures raise a timeout error if they have not completed within the timeout. You can
return errors instead of raising them by passing `_catch_errors => true` to `wait()`. The `wait()`
function returns the results from the Future blocks once they've all finished. If a Future errors,
Bolt only raises the error after all other Futures finish executing and return to `wait()`.

### `parallelize()` plan function

The experimental `parallelize()` function accepts an array and a block,
and runs the entire block on each array element in parallel. Inside a parallelize block, targets can
run subsequent plan functions before all targets have finished each step. For example, this plan
runs the block to execute two commands on each target in parallel, regardless of how long it takes
the block to run on any one target:

```
# $targets = target1,target2,target3
plan myplan(TargetSpec $targets) {
  # Convert the input into an array of targets
  $ts = get_targets($targets)

  parallelize($ts) |$target| {
    run_command('hostname', $target)
    run_command('whoami', $target)
  }
}
```

Here, if `target3` completes running `hostname` before `target1` or `target2`, it can continue directly to
running `whoami`.

This functionality is particularly useful for plan functions that may take a long time on certain
targets but not on others, or for plans where some long running process may fail on a target but the
plan author wants the plan to be able to continue quickly on successful targets.


#### How plan functions run in parallel

Within a backgrounded code block, only the following functions can run in parallel: 
- `run_command`
- `run_task`
- `run_task_with`
- `run_script`
- `upload_file`
- `download_file`. 
You can run other functions from a parallelize or background block, but those functions will block
execution on other targets until they complete. For example, in the following plan, Bolt can start
running `task2` and `task3` while `task1` is still executing. However, it cannot start `task4` while
`out::message` is executing on any of the targets.

```
# $targets = target1,target2,target3
plan myplan(TargetSpec $targets) {
  # Convert the input into an array of targets
  $ts = get_targets($targets)

  parallelize($ts) |$target| {
    run_task('task1', $target)
    run_task('task2', $target)
    $result = run_task('task3', $target)
    out::message($result)
    run_task('task4', $target)
  }
}
```

#### Getting results from parallel blocks

The `parallelize()` and `wait()` functions return an array that contains the results of executing
the block in the same order as the input array. You can think of them as `map` functions
that run in parallel. The `result` of the block for a particular input is either a value passed to
a `return` statement, the result of the last function in the block, or an error.

For example, consider the following plan:
```
$ts = get_targets($targets)
$result = parallelize($ts) |$target| {
    if $target.name == 'target1' {
      return "Don't run the task on this target"
    }
    run_task('task1', $target)
    run_command('hostname', $target)
  }

# This will print ["Don't run the task on this target", "target2", "target3"]
out::message($result)
```

Similarly, using `wait()`:
```
$ts = get_targets($targets)
$futures = $ts.map |$target| {
  background() || {
    if $target.name == 'target1' {
      return "Don't run the task on this target"
    }
    run_task('task1', $target)
    run_command('hostname', $target)
  }
}
$result = wait($futures)

# This will print ["Don't run the task on this target", "target2", "target3"]
out::message($result)
```

If any step of the block errors, Bolt stops executing the block for that target, but continues
executing for all other targets from the input array. When the block finishes, if there is an error
in the result array, the plan throws a `PlanFailure` and includes the entire result array in the
`details` key of the failure. If the block is wrapped in a `catch_errors()` block, Bolt catches the
`PlanFailure` and continues to execute the plan. If you've provided `_catch_errors => true`
to `wait()`, Bolt returns any errors raised and the plan continues to execute.

#### Viewing failing results in parallel blocks

When an action fails in a parallel block, such as a task returning an error, Bolt
does not print the error result to the console. For example, the following plan
runs a non-existent command on targets in parallel:

```puppet
plan example (
  TargetSpec $targets
) {
  $_targets = get_targets($targets)

  $results = parallelize($_targets) |$target| {
    run_command('badcommand', $target)
  }

  return $results
}
```

Bolt does not print the error result from the targets the command is run on,
making it difficult to know why the command failed:

```shell
$ bolt plan run example -t target1,target2

Starting: plan example
Starting: command 'badcommand' on target1
Starting: command 'badcommand' on target2
Finished: command 'badcommand' with 1 failure in 0.01 sec
Finished: command 'badcommand' with 1 failure in 0.02 sec
Error in future '2': run_command 'badcommand' failed on 1 target [ID: errored_futures]
Error in future '3': run_command 'badcommand' failed on 1 target [ID: errored_futures]
Finished: plan example in 1.53 sec
parallel block failed on 2 targets
  (file: /Users/bolt/.puppetlabs/bolt/plans/init.pp, line: 4, column: 14)
```

To view error results from parallel blocks, you can run the plan in verbose mode.
To run in verbose mode, use the `verbose` flag:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt plan run <PLAN NAME> --verbose
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltPlan -Name <PLAN NAME> -Verbose
```

Running the same plan in verbose mode shows the error results for each target:

```shell
$ bolt plan run example -t target1,target2

Starting: plan example
Starting: command 'badcommand' on target1
Starting: command 'badcommand' on target2
Started on target1...
Failed on target1:
  No such file or directory - badcommand
Started on target2...
Failed on target2:
  No such file or directory - badcommand
Finished: command 'badcommand' with 1 failure in 0.01 sec
Finished: command 'badcommand' with 1 failure in 0.02 sec
Error in future '2': run_command 'badcommand' failed on 1 target [ID: errored_futures]
Error in future '3': run_command 'badcommand' failed on 1 target [ID: errored_futures]
Finished: plan example in 1.53 sec
parallel block failed on 2 targets
  (file: /Users/bolt/.puppetlabs/bolt/plans/init.pp, line: 4, column: 14)
```

## `ResourceInstance` data type

This feature was introduced in [Bolt
2.10.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-2100-2020-05-18).

Bolt has had a limited ability to interact with Puppet's Resource Abstraction
Layer. You could use the `apply` function to generate catalogs and return
events, and the `get_resources` plan function can be used to query resources on
a target. The `ResourceInstance` data type is the first step in enabling plan
authors to build resource-based logic into their plans to enable a
discover-inspect-execute workflow for interacting with resources on remote
systems.

Use the `ResourceInstance` data type is used to store information about a single
resource on a target, including its observed state, desired state, and any
related events.

> **Note::** The `ResourceInstance` data type does not interact with or modify
  resources in any way. It is only used to store information about a resource.

### Creating `ResourceInstance` objects

#### `Target.set_resources()`

The recommended way to create `ResourceInstance` objects is by setting them
directly on a `Target` object using the `Target.set_resources` function. Use the
function to set one or more resources on a target at a time. You can read more
about this function in [Bolt plan functions](plan_functions.md#set_resources).

The `Target.set_resources` function can set existing `ResourceInstance` objects
on a target, or take hashes of parameters to create new `ResourceInstance`
objects and automatically set them on a target.

When setting resources using a hash of parameters, you can pass either a single
hash or an array of hashes:

```ruby
$init_hash = {
  'target'        => Optional[Target],
  'type'          => Variant[String[1], Type[Resource]],
  'title'         => String[1],
  'state'         => Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]],
  'desired_state' => Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]],
  'events'        => Optional[Array[Hash[String[1], Data]]]
}

$target.set_resources(
  Variant[Hash[String[1], Any], Array[Hash[String[1], Any]]] init_hash
)
```

> **Note:** When passing a data hash to `Target.set_resources`, the `target`
  parameter is **optional**. If the `target` parameter is not specified, the
  function automatically sets the target to the target the function is called
  on.

> **Note:** If the `target` parameter is any target other than the one you are
  setting the resource on, Bolt will raise an error.

When setting resources using existing `ResourceInstance` objects, you can pass
either a single `ResourceInstance` or an array of `ResourceInstance` objects.

```ruby
$resource = ResourceInstance.new(...)

$target.set_resources(
  Variant[ResourceInstance, Array[ResourceInstance]] resource
)
```

> **Note:** If the target for a `ResourceInstance` does not match the target it
  is being set on, Bolt will raise an error.

A target can only have a single instance of a given resource. If you set a
duplicate resource on a target, Bolt shallow merges the `state` and
`desired_state` of the duplicate resource with the `state` and `desired_state`
of the existing resource and adds any `events` for the duplicate resource to the
existing resource.

#### `ResourceInstance.new()`

You can also create standalone `ResourceInstance` objects without setting them
directly on a target using the `new` function.

The `new` function accepts either positional arguments:

```ruby
ResourceInstance.new(
  Target                                 target,
  Variant[String[1], Type[Resource]]     type,
  String[1]                              title,
  Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]]        state,
  Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]]        desired_state,
  Optional[Array[Hash[String[1], Data]]] events
)
```

or a hash of arguments:

```ruby
$init_hash = {
  'target'        => Target,
  'type'          => Variant[String[1], Type[Resource]],
  'title'         => String[1],
  'state'         => Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]],
  'desired_state' => Optional[Hash[String[1], Data]],
  'events'        => Optional[Array[Hash[String[1], Data]]]
}

ResourceInstance.new(
  Hash[String[1], Any] init_hash
)
```

### Accessing `ResourceInstance` object on a Target

You can retrieve a specific `ResourceInstance` object stored on a Target in a
plan using the `resource()` function:

```
$packages = $target.get_resources(Package).first['resources']
$target.set_resources($packages)
$resource = $target.resource(Package, 'openssl')
out::message($resource.reference)
```

### Attributes

Each `ResourceInstance` has the following attributes:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | The target that the resource is for. | `Target` |
| `type` | The [type of the resource](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/type.html). This can be either the stringified name of the resource type or the actual type itself. For example, both `"file"` and `File` are acceptable. | `Variant[String[1], Type[Resource]]` |
| `title` | The title, or [namevar](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/type.html#namevars-and-titles), of the resource. | `String[1]` |
| `state` | The _observed state_ of the resource. This is the point-in-time state of the resource when it is queried. | `Hash[String[1], Data]` |
| `desired_state` | The _desired state_ of the resource. This is the state that you want the resource to be in. | `Hash[String[1], Data]` |
| `events` | Resource events that are generated from reports. | `Array[Hash[String[1], Data]]` | 

A `ResourceInstance` is identified by its `target`, `type`, and `title`. As
such, these three parameters _must_ be specified when creating a new
`ResourceInstance` and are immutable. Since `Target.set_resources` will
automatically set the `target` when passing a hash of parameters, the `target`
parameter can be ommitted.

The `state`, `desired_state`, and `events` parameters are optional when creating
a `ResourceInstance`. If you do not specify `state` and `desired_state`, they
default to empty hashes, while `events` defaults to an empty array. You can
modify each of these attributes during the lifetime of the `ResourceInstance`
using [the data type's functions](bolt_types_reference.md#resourceinstance).

### Functions

The `ResourceInstance` data type has several built-in functions. These range
from accessing the object's attributes to modifying and overwriting state. For a
full list of the available functions, see [Bolt data
types](bolt_types_reference.md#resourceinstance).

### Example usage

You can easily set a resource on a set of targets. For example, if you want to
ensure that a file is present on each target:

```ruby
$resource = {
  'type'  => File,
  'title' => '/etc/puppetlabs/bolt/bolt-defaults.yaml',
  'desired_state' => {
    'ensure'  => 'present',
    'content' => "..."
  }
}

$targets.each |$target| {
  $target.set_resources($resource)
}
```

You can also combine the `get_resources` plan function with
`Target.set_resources` to query resources on a target and set them on the
corresponding `Target` objects:

```ruby
$results = $targets.get_resources([Package, User])

$results.each |$result| {
  $result.target.set_resources($result['resources'])
}
```

The `set_resources` function will return an array of `ResourceInstance` objects,
which can be used to easily examine attributes for multiple resources and
perform actions based on those attributes. For example, you can iterate over an
array of resources to determine which users need to have their maxium password
age modified:

```ruby
$results = $target.get_resources(User)

$results.each |$result| {
  $resources = $result.target.set_resources($result['resources'])

  $users = $resources.filter |$resource| { $resource.state['password_max_age'] > 90 }
                     .map |$resource| { $resource.title }

  run_task('update_password_max_age', $result.target, 'users' => $users)
}
```

Apply blocks will also return results with reports. These reports have resource
data hashes that can be used to set resources on a target:

```ruby
$apply_results = apply($targets) {
  File { '/etc/puppetlabs':
    ensure => present
  }
  Package { 'openssl':
    ensure => installed
  }
}

$apply_results.each |$result| {
  $result.target.set_resources($result.report['resource_statuses'].values)
}
```

## Native SSH transport

This feature was introduced in [Bolt
2.10.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-2100-2020-05-18).

Bolt's SSH transport uses the ruby library `net-ssh`, which is a pure ruby
implementation of the SSH2 client protocol. While robust, the library lacks
support for some features and algorithms that are available in native SSH. When
you use the native SSH transport, Bolt uses the SSH executable you've
specified instead of using `net-ssh`. Essentially, using the native SSH
transport is the same as running SSH on your command line, but with Bolt
managing the connections.

To use the native SSH transport, under the `config` option in your inventory
file, set `native-ssh: true` and `ssh-command: <SSH COMMAND>`, where
`<SSH COMMAND>` is your native SSH executable.

For example:

```yaml
ssh:
  native-ssh: true
  ssh-command: 'ssh' 
```

The value of `ssh-command` can be either a string or an array, and you can
provide any command-line options to the command. Bolt appends
Bolt-configuration settings to the command, as well as the specified target,
when connecting. Not all Bolt configuration options are supported using the
native SSH transport, but you can configure most options in your OpenSSH Config.
See [Transport configuration options](bolt_transports_reference.md#ssh) for a list
of supported Bolt SSH options.

Bolt transports have two main functions: executing remotely, and copying files
to the remote targets. `ssh-command` is what configures the remote execution,
and `copy-command` configures the copy command. The default is `scp -r`, and
`rsync` is not supported at this time.

For example:
```
ssh:
  ssh-command: 'ssh'
  copy-command: 'scp -r -F ~/ssh-config/myconf'
```

### Connecting with SSH configuration not supported by net-ssh

You can use the native SSH transport to connect to targets using configuration
that isn't supported by the Ruby net-ssh library. Configure the settings for the
transport in your inventory file, or use your local SSH config. 

#### Using an inventory file to specify SSH configuration

To encrypt SSH connections using the unsupported algorithm 
`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`, add the SSH command and cypher
option to your inventory file: 

```
# inventory.yaml
config:
  ssh:
    ssh-command:
      - 'ssh'
      - '-o Ciphers=chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com'
```

#### Using `~/.ssh/config` to specify SSH configuration

To encrypt SSH connections using the unsupported algorithm 
`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`:
1. Store the following config in your SSH config at `~/.ssh/config` as:
   ```
   Ciphers+=chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
   ```

2. In your inventory file, configure Bolt to use the SSH shell command:
   ```
   # inventory.yaml
   config:
     ssh:
       ssh-command: 'ssh'
   ```

> **Note**: While some OpenSSH config options are supported in net-ssh, such as Ciphers, the specific
> algorithms you want to use might not be supported and you will still need to use the `ssh-command`
> option to shell out to SSH. See [the net-ssh
> README](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/#supported-algorithms) for a list of supported
> algorithms.
