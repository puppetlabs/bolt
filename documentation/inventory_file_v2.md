# Inventory files

Use an inventory file to store information about your targets and arrange them
into groups. Grouping your targets lets you aim your Bolt commands at the group
instead of having to reference each target individually.

An inventory file is part of a Bolt project and must exist alongside a
`bolt-project.yaml` file. For more information, see [Bolt projects](projects.md).

> **Note**: Version 1 inventory files are deprecated. If you're using version 1
> inventory files, make sure to migrate them to version 2. For more information
> on migrating to version 2, see [Migrating your inventory files to version
> 2](./migrating_inventory_files.md).

## Inventory file structure

### Top-level fields

The top level of an inventory file acts as the implicit `all` group and has
similar fields as a `groups` object.

The following fields are available at the top level of a version 2 inventory
file:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `config` | The configuration for the `all` group. Optional. For more information see [Configuring Bolt](configuring_bolt.md#inventoryyaml).  | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the `all` group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the `all` group. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `groups` | A list of targets and groups and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Group]` |
| `targets` | A list of targets and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Target]` |
| `vars` | The vars for the `all` group. Optional. | `Hash` |

### Group object

A group lists a set of `targets` and `groups` and their associated
configuration. Each group is a map that can contain any of the following fields:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `config` | The configuration for the group. Optional. For more information see [Configuring Bolt](configuring_bolt.md#inventoryyaml). | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the group. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `groups` | A list of groups and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Group]` |
| `name` | The name of the group. **Required.** | `String` |
| `targets` | A list of targets and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Target]` |
| `vars` | The variables for the group. Optional. | `Hash` |

An example of an inventory file with two groups named `linux` and `windows`:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    targets:
      - target1.example.com
      - target2.example.com
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - name: windows
    targets:
      - target3.example.com
      - target4.example.com
    config:
      transport: winrm
```

### Target object

Specify a target under the `targets` key. The `targets` key accepts an array
where each element is either a string or a hash. 
- For a string, use the string representation of the target's Universal Resource
  Identifier (URI).
- A hash must specify either the `uri` for a hash, or a `name`. If you don't
  specify a `name`, Bolt uses the `uri` as the target's name. To make it easier to run Bolt commands
  on the target, specify both a `uri` and a `name` and run your commands against
  the `name`.

Bolt uses the target's `uri` to establish a connection to the target. If you set
a `name` and no `uri`, you must specify the hostname for the target using the
`host` key in your transport configuration. If the transport you're using does
not support hostname configuration, you must set a `uri`.

An example of two targets specified with the string representations of
their URIs:

```yaml
targets:
  - target1.example.com
  - target2.example.com
```

An example of two targets specified with `uri` and `name` in hashes:

```yaml
targets:
  - uri: target1.example.com
    name: target1
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - uri: target2.example.com
    name: target2
    config:
      transport: winrm
```

An example of a target specified with `name` and no `uri`. In this case, Bolt
uses the hostname of the target from the transport's `host` key to establish a
connection with the target:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: target1
    config:
      transport: ssh
      ssh:
        host: target1.example.com
```

Similar to `name`, you can specify an `alias` as another way to refer to a
target. In the following example, you could run a command using the target's
`uri`, `name`, or `alias`.

```yaml
targets:
  - uri: target1.example.com
    name: target1
    alias: dashboard
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - uri: target2.example.com
    name: target2
    alias: database
    config:
      transport: winrm
```

Targets specified with a hash accept the following fields:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `alias` | A unique alias to refer to the target. Optional. | `String` |
| `config` | The configuration for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the target. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `name` | A human-readable name for a target.<br> **Required** when specifying a target using a hash. Optional if using `uri`. If you don't specify a `name`, Bolt uses the `uri` as the target name. | `String` |
| `uri` | The URI of the target. Bolt uses the `uri` to establish a connection to the target. <br> **Required** when specifying a target using a hash, unless you specify a `name` **and** configure a hostname using `host` in the target's transport configuration.| `String` |
| `vars` | The variables for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |

## Showing inventory

The following command provides a quick way to view the resolved values for a
target or group of targets:

- _\*nix shell command_

  ```shell
  bolt inventory show --targets <TARGET LIST> --detail
  ```

- _PowerShell cmdlet_

  ```powershell
  Get-BoltInventory -Targets <TARGET LIST> -Detail
  ```

## Precedence

When searching for a target's configuration data, Bolt matches a target's URI
with its name. Bolt uses depth-first search and uses the first value it finds.

The `config` values for a target object, such as `host`, `transport`, and
`port`, take precedent and override any `config` values at the group level. Bolt
merges non-`config` data in the target object, such as `facts` and `vars`, with
data in the group object.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: group1
    targets:
      - name: mytarget
        uri: target.example.com
        config:
          ssh:
            user: puppet
        facts:
          hardwaremodel: x86_64
      - name: myothertarget
        uri: target2.example.com
    config:
      ssh:
        host-key-check: false
  - name: group2
    targets:
      - name: mytarget
        uri: target.example.com
        config:
          ssh:
            password: bolt
    config:
      ssh:
        password: password
    facts:
      operatingsystem: CentOS

```

In the example above,  `mytarget` in `group1` contains the fact, `hardwaremodel:
x86_64.` The fact `operatingsystem: CentOS` is set in `group2` which also
contains `mytarget`.

Showing the detailed inventory for `mytarget` will return both facts:

```json
â€¦

"facts": {
  "operatingsystem": "CentOS",
  "hardwaremodel": "x86_64"
},
```

Inventory files are not context-aware. Any data set for a target, whether in a
target definition or a group, apply to all definitions of the target. For
example, the inventory file above contains two definitions of `mytarget`. The
values for `user` and `host-key-check` are set in `group1`. The value for
`password` is set in `group2`. If you ran a Bolt command on `group2`, all three
values would be set on `mytarget`.

Showing the detailed inventory for `group` will return all three configuration
values:


```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "mytarget",
      "uri": "target.example.com",
      "config": {
        "ssh": {
          "host-key-check": false,
          "password": "bolt",
          "user": "puppet"
        },
        "transport": "ssh"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
> **Note**: The password for mytarget is defined at the target level in
> `group2`, and overrides the password set at the group level.

## Plugins

Use plugins to dynamically load information into the inventory file. Plugins
either ship with Bolt, or are installed as Puppet modules that have the same
name as the plugin. The plugin framework is based on a set of plugin hooks that
are implemented by plugin authors and called by Bolt.

> **Note:** Plugins are only available in version 2 inventory files.

  plugins](supported_plugins.md).

  plugins](./using_plugins.md).

## Inventory file examples

### Basic inventory file

The following inventory file contains a basic hierarchy of groups and targets.
As with all inventory files, it has a top-level group named `all`, which refers
to all targets in the inventory. The `all` group has two subgroups named `linux`
and `windows`.

The `linux` group lists its targets and sets the default transport for the
targets to the SSH protocol.

The `windows` group lists its targets and sets the default transport for the
targets to the WinRM protocol.

The inventory file sets top-level configuration that applies to the `all` group.
It sets default configuration for the `ssh` and `winrm` transports.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    targets:
      - target1.example.com
      - target2.example.com
    config:
      transport: ssh
      ssh:
        private-key: /path/to/private_key.pem
  - name: windows
    targets:
      - name: win1
        uri: target3.example.com
      - name: win2
        uri: target4.example.com
    config:
      transport: winrm
config:
  ssh:
    host-key-check: false
  winrm:
    user: Administrator
    password: Bolt!
    ssl: false
```

### Detailed inventory file

The following inventory file contains a more detailed hierarchy of groups and
targets. As with all inventory files, it has a top-level group named `all`,
which refers to all targets in the inventory. The `all` group has two subgroups
named `ssh_nodes` and `win_nodes`.

The `ssh_nodes` group has two subgroups - `webservers` and `memcached` - and
sets the default transport for targets in the group to the SSH protocol. It also
specifies a few configuration options for the SSH transport. Each of the
subgroups lists the targets in the group and the `memcached` group has
additional SSH transport configuration for its targets.

The `win_nodes` group also has two subgroups - `domaincontrollers` and
`testservers` - and sets the default transport for targets in the group to the
WinRM protocol. It also specifies a few configuration options for the WinRM
transport. Each of the subgroups lists the targets in the group and the
`testservers` group has additional WinRM transport configuration for its
targets.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: ssh_nodes
    groups:
      - name: webservers
        targets:
          - 192.168.100.179
          - 192.168.100.180
          - 192.168.100.181
      - name: memcached
        targets:
          - 192.168.101.50
          - 192.168.101.60
        config:
          ssh:
            user: root
    config:
      transport: ssh
      ssh:
        user: centos
        private-key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        host-key-check: false
  - name: win_nodes
    groups:
      - name: domaincontrollers
        targets:
          - 192.168.110.10
          - 192.168.110.20
      - name: testservers
        targets:
          - 172.16.219.20
          - 172.16.219.30
        config:
          winrm:
            realm: MYDOMAIN
            ssl: false
    config:
      transport: winrm
      winrm:
        user: DOMAIN\opsaccount
        password: S3cretP@ssword
        ssl: true
```

### Inventory file with plugins

The following inventory file uses several bundled plugins.

* The `yaml` plugin composes `aws_inventory.yaml` and `azure_inventory.yaml`
  into a single inventory file loaded by Bolt.
* The `aws_inventory` plugin generates targets from AWS EC2 instances.
* The `azure_inventory` plugin generates targets from Azure VMs.
* The `vault` plugin loads a secret from a Hashicorp Vault server and uses it as
  a password.
* The `prompt` plugin configures the `vault` plugin in a configuration file and
  prompts for the user's Vault password.

The `inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
groups:
  - _plugin: yaml
    filepath: inventory/aws_inventory.yaml
  - _plugin: yaml
    filepath: inventory/azure_inventory.yaml
```

The `aws_inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: aws
targets:
  - _plugin: aws_inventory
    region: us-west-1
    target_mapping:
      uri: public_ip_address
config:
  transport: ssh
  ssh:
    user: ec2-user
    password:
      _plugin: vault
      path: secrets/aws
      field: password
```

The `azure_inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: azure
targets:
  - _plugin: azure_inventory
    location: westus
config:
  transport: winrm
  winrm:
    user: Administrator
    password:
      _plugin: vault
      path: secrets/azure
      field: password
```

The `bolt-project.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
plugins:
  vault:
    server_url: https://127.0.0.1:8200
    cacert: /path/to/cert/cacert.pem
    auth:
      method: userpass
      user: developer
      pass:
        _plugin: prompt
        message: Enter your Vault password
```
