# Inventory file version 2

Use an inventory file to store information about your targets and arrange them into groups. Grouping your targets lets you aim your Bolt commands at the group instead of having to reference each target individually.

The command `bolt inventory show -t <TARGET> --detail` provides a quick way to view the resolved values for a target or group of targets.

> **Note**: Version 1 inventory files are deprecated. If you're using version 1 inventory files, make sure to migrate them to version 2. For more information on migrating to version 2, see [Migrating your inventory files to version 2](./migrating_inventory_files.md).

## Inventory file structure

### Top-level fields

The top level of an inventory file acts as the implicit `all` group and has similar fields as a `groups` object.

The following fields are available at the top level of a version 2 inventory file:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `config` | The configuration for the `all` group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the `all` group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the `all` group. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `groups` | A list of targets and groups and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Group]` |
| `targets` | A list of targets and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Target]` |
| `vars` | The vars for the `all` group. Optional. | `Hash` |

### Group object

A group lists a set of `targets` and `groups` and their associated configuration. Each group is a map that can contain any of the following fields:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `config` | The configuration for the group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the group. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the group. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `groups` | A list of groups and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Group]` |
| `name` | The name of the group. **Required.** | `String` |
| `targets` | A list of targets and their associated configuration. Optional. | `Array[Target]` |
| `vars` | The variables for the group. Optional. | `Hash` |

An example of an inventory file with two groups named `linux` and `windows`:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    targets:
      - target1.example.com
      - target2.example.com
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - name: windows
    targets:
      - target3.example.com
      - target4.example.com
    config:
      transport: winrm
```

### Target object

You can specify a target with the string representation of a URI, or as a hash with any of the following fields:

| Key | Description | Type |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| `alias` | A unique alias to refer to the target. Optional. | `String` |
| `config` | The configuration for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `facts` | The facts for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |
| `features` | The features for the target. Optional. | `Array[String]`
| `name` | A human-readable name for a target.<br> **Required** when specifying a target using a hash. Optional if using `uri`. | `String` |
| `uri` | The URI of the target.<br> **Required** when specifying a target using a hash. Optional if using `name`. | `String` |
| `vars` | The variables for the target. Optional. | `Hash` |

An example of targets specified with the string representations of their URIs:

```yaml
targets:
  - target1.example.com
  - target2.example.com
```

An example of targets specified with hashes:

```yaml
targets:
  - uri: target1.example.com
    alias: target1
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - uri: target2.example.com
    alias: target2
    config:
      transport: winrm
```


## Precedence

When searching for a target's configuration data, Bolt matches a target's URI with its name. Bolt uses depth-first search and uses the first value it finds.

The `config` values for a target object, such as `host`, `transport`, and `port`, take precedent and override any `config` values at the group level. Bolt merges non-`config` data in the target object, such as `facts` and `vars`, with data in the group object.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: group1
    targets:
      - name: mytarget
        uri: target.example.com
        config:
          ssh:
            user: puppet
        facts:
          hardwaremodel: x86_64
      - name: myothertarget
        uri: target2.example.com
    config:
      ssh:
        host-key-check: false
  - name: group2
    targets:
      - name: mytarget
        uri: target.example.com
        config:
          ssh:
            password: bolt
    config:
      ssh:
        password: password
    facts:
      operatingsystem: CentOS

```

In the example above,  `mytarget` in `group1` contains the fact, `hardwaremodel:
x86_64.` The fact `operatingsystem: CentOS` is set in `group2` which also contains `mytarget`.

Running `bolt inventory show -t group1 --detail` returns both facts for `mytarget`:

```json
â€¦

"facts": {
  "operatingsystem": "CentOS",
  "hardwaremodel": "x86_64"
},
```

Inventory files are not context-aware. Any data set for a target, whether in a target definition or a group, apply to all definitions of the target. For example, the inventory file above contains two definitions of `mytarget`. The values for `user` and `host-key-check` are set in `group1`. The value for `password` is set in `group2`. If you ran a Bolt command on `group2`, all three values would be set on `mytarget`. Running `bolt inventory show -t group2 --detail` shows the three configuration values:


```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "mytarget",
      "uri": "target.example.com",
      "config": {
        "ssh": {
          "host-key-check": false,
          "password": "bolt",
          "user": "puppet"
        },
        "transport": "ssh"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
> **Note**: The password for mytarget is defined at the target level in `group2`, and overrides the password set at the group level.

## Plugins

Use plugins to dynamically load information into the inventory file. Plugins
either ship with Bolt, or are installed as Puppet modules that have the same
name as the plugin. The plugin framework is based on a set of plugin hooks that
are implemented by plugin authors and called by Bolt.

> **Note:** Plugins are only available in version 2 inventory files.

For more information about plugins, see [Using plugins](./using_plugins.md).

## Inventory file examples

### Basic inventory file

The following inventory file contains a basic hierarchy of groups and targets. As with all inventory files, it has a top-level group named `all`, which refers to all targets in the inventory. The `all` group has two subgroups named `linux` and `windows`.

The `linux` group lists its targets and sets the default transport for the targets to the SSH protocol.

The `windows` group lists its targets and sets the default transport for the targets to the WinRM protocol.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    targets:
      - target1.example.com
      - target2.example.com
    config:
      transport: ssh
  - name: windows
    targets:
      - uri: target3.example.com
        alias: windows1
      - uri: target4.example.com
        alias: windows2
    config:
      transport: winrm
```

### Detailed inventory file

The following inventory file contains a more detailed hierarchy of groups and targets. As with all inventory files, it has a top-level group named `all`, which refers to all targets in the inventory. The `all` group has two subgroups named `ssh_nodes` and `win_nodes`.

The `ssh_nodes` group has two subgroups - `webservers` and `memcached` - and sets the default transport for targets in the group to the SSH protocol. It also specifies a few configuration options for the SSH transport. Each of the subgroups lists the targets in the group and the `memcached` group has additional SSH transport configuration for its targets.

The `win_nodes` group also has two subgroups - `domaincontrollers` and `testservers` - and sets the default transport for targets in the group to the WinRM protocol. It also specifies a few configuration options for the WinRM transport. Each of the subgroups lists the targets in the group and the `testservers` group has additional WinRM transport configuration for its targets.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: ssh_nodes
    groups:
      - name: webservers
        targets:
          - 192.168.100.179
          - 192.168.100.180
          - 192.168.100.181
      - name: memcached
        targets:
          - 192.168.101.50
          - 192.168.101.60
        config:
          ssh:
            user: root
    config:
      transport: ssh
      ssh:
        user: centos
        private-key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        host-key-check: false
  - name: win_nodes
    groups:
      - name: domaincontrollers
        targets:
          - 192.168.110.10
          - 192.168.110.20
      - name: testservers
        targets:
          - 172.16.219.20
          - 172.16.219.30
        config:
          winrm:
            realm: MYDOMAIN
            ssl: false
    config:
      transport: winrm
      winrm:
        user: DOMAIN\opsaccount
        password: S3cretP@ssword
        ssl: true
```

### Using plugins

The following inventory file uses several bundled plugins.

* The `yaml` plugin composes `aws_inventory.yaml` and `azure_inventory.yaml` into a single inventory file loaded by Bolt.
* The `aws_inventory` plugin generates targets from AWS EC2 instances.
* The `azure_inventory` plugin generates targets from Azure VMs.
* The `vault` plugin loads a secret from a Hashicorp Vault server and uses it as a password.
* The `prompt` plugin configures the `vault` plugin in a configuration file and prompts for the user's Vault password.

The `inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
groups:
  - _plugin: yaml
    filepath: inventory/aws_inventory.yaml
  - _plugin: yaml
    filepath: inventory/azure_inventory.yaml
```

The `aws_inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: aws
targets:
  - _plugin: aws_inventory
    region: us-west-1
    target_mapping:
      uri: public_ip_address
config:
  transport: ssh
  ssh:
    user: ec2-user
    password:
      _plugin: vault
      path: secrets/aws
      field: password
```

The `azure_inventory.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: azure
targets:
  - _plugin: azure_inventory
    location: westus
config:
  transport: winrm
  winrm:
    user: Administrator
    password:
      _plugin: vault
      path: secrets/azure
      field: password
```

The `bolt.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
plugins:
  vault:
    server_url: https://127.0.0.1:8200
    cacert: /path/to/cert/cacert.pem
    auth:
      method: userpass
      user: developer
      pass:
        _plugin: prompt
        message: Enter your Vault password
```

To verify that plugin references are resolved correctly and to view the targets and values loaded, use the command `bolt inventory show -t all --detail`.
