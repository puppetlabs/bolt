# Run commands on remote targets

You can use Bolt commands to connect to remote targets and perform actions on
them. These actions range in complexity from invoking a simple command to
running a series of commands and tasks as part of an orchestration workflow. 

For a full list of available Bolt commands, see the [Bolt command
reference](bolt_command_reference.md).

## Run a command

Bolt can run arbitrary commands on remote targets. To run a command, provide a
command and a list of targets to run the command on.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'Get-Location' -Targets servers
```

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** If a command contains spaces or special shell characters, wrap
> the command in single quotation marks.

### Run a quoted command

If you need to run a command that uses quotation marks, you must properly escape
the quotations. The way you escape the quotations depends on whether you're
using Bash or PowerShell.

In a Bash shell, use backslashes `\` or double the the quotation marks:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run "Get-WMIObject Win32_Service -Filter ""Name like '%mon'""" -t localhost
```

In a PowerShell shell, use a combination of backslashes `\` and doubling of
quotation marks. The example below uses two double quotation marks to quote the
value being passed to `Filter`, however the example also uses a backslash so
that Bolt's underlying Ruby argument parser accepts the command.

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command "Get-WMIObject Win32_Service -Filter \""Name like '%mon'\""" -Targets localhost
```

### Read a command from a file

Reading a command from a file is useful when you need to run a script on a target 
that does not permit file uploads. To read a command from a file, pass an `@` symbol, 
followed by the relative path to the file.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run @configure.sh --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command '@configure.ps1' -Targets servers
```

> **Note:** In PowerShell, always wrap the file name in single quotes.

### Read a command from stdin

To read a command from standard input (stdin), pipe the results from another
command to Bolt and pass a single dash (`-`) as the command.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
cat command.sh | bolt command run - --targets servers
```

Reading from stdin is not supported by the PowerShell module.

## Specify targets

The most common way to specify targets on the command line is with the
`targets` option. This option accepts a comma-separated list of targets.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets bolt1.example.org,bolt2.example.org
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets bolt1.example.org,bolt2.example.org
```

### Specify targets from an inventory file

If you have an inventory file, you can list targets and groups of targets by
name instead of using the target's Universal Resource Identifier (URI).

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets servers,databases
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets servers,databases
```

### Specify targets using glob matching

Bolt supports glob matches for targets. This is helpful when you have several
targets that you want to run a comand on that have similar names. For example,
to run a command on all targets that start with the word `bolt`:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets 'bolt*'
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets 'bolt*'
```

### Read targets from a file

To read a file of targets, pass an `@` symbol, followed by the relative path to
the file, to the `targets` option.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets '@targets.txt'
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets '@targets.txt'
```

> **Note:** In PowerShell, always wrap the file name in single quotes.

### Read targets from stdin

To read a list of targets from stdin, pipe the results from another command to
Bolt and pass a single dash (`-`) to the `targets` option.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
cat targets.txt | bolt command run 'pwd' --targets -
```

Reading from stdin is not supported by the PowerShell module.

### Specify targets from the previous command

After every execution, Bolt writes information about the result of that run to a
`.rerun.json` file inside the Bolt project directory. You can use the
`.rerun.json` file together with the `rerun` option to specify targets for
future commands. The `rerun` option accepts one of three values:

- `success`: The list of targets the command succeeded on.
- `failure`: The list of targets the command failed on.
- `all`: All of the targets the command ran on.

For example, if you need to run a command that is dependent on the success of
the previous command, you can target the successful targets with the `success`
value.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt task run restart_server --targets servers --rerun success
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltTask -Name restart_server -Targets servers -Rerun success
``` 

#### Disable `.rerun.json`

If you want to preserve the results of a specific Bolt run and run multiple
`rerun` commands against it, you can disable the `.rerun.json` file.

_\*nix shell command_

Use the `--no-save-rerun` option to disable saving the rerun file:

```shell
bolt task run restart_server --targets server --rerun success --no-save-rerun
```
_PowerShell cmdlet_

Use the `-SaveRerun` argument with a value of `$false` to disable saving the
rerun file:

```powershell
Invoke-BoltTask -Name restart_server -Targets servers -Rerun success -SaveRerun:$false
```

## Specify connection credentials

To establish connections with remote targets, Bolt needs to provide credentials
to the target. You can provide credentials at the command line or in an
inventory file, and the credentials you provide might vary based on the
operating system the target is running.

Whether a target is running a Unix-like operating system or Windows, the
simplest way to specify credentials is to pass the `user` and `password`
to the Bolt command:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets servers --user bolt --password puppet
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets servers -User bolt -Password puppet
```

If you'd prefer to have Bolt securely prompt for a password, so that it does not
appear in a process listing or on the console, use the `password-prompt` option
instead:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'pwd' --targets servers --user bolt --password-prompt
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'pwd' -Targets servers -User bolt -PasswordPrompt
```

## Specify a transport

Bolt uses a specific transport to establish a connection with a target. By
default, Bolt connects to targets using the `ssh` transport. You can use one of
the methods below to set a different transport from the command line, or you can
configure transports in your inventory file.

You can specify the transport used to connect to a specific target by setting
it as the protocol in the target's URI:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'Get-Location' --targets winrm://windows.example.org
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'Get-Location' -Targets winrm://windows.example.org
```

You can also use the `transport` command-line option:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt command run 'Get-Location' --targets windows.example.org --transport winrm
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltCommand -Command 'Get-Location' -Targets windows.example.org -Transport winrm
```

## Run a script

When you run a script on a remote target, Bolt copies the script from your
workstation to a temporary directory on the target, runs the script, and then
deletes the script from the target.

You can run scripts in any language, as long as the appropriate interpreter is
installed on the remote system. This includes scripting languages such as Bash,
PowerShell, Python, and Ruby.

To run a script, provide the path to the script on the workstation and a list of
targets to run the script on.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt script run ./scripts/configure.sh --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltScript -Script ./scripts/configure.ps1 -Targets servers
```

### Pass arguments to a script

Argument values are passed literally and are not interpolated by the shell on
the remote host.

_\*nix shell command_

To pass arguments to a script, specify them after the command:

```shell
bolt script run ./scripts/configure.sh --targets servers arg1 arg2
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

To pass arguments to a script, use the `-Arguments` parameter:

```powershell
Invoke-BoltScript -Script ./scripts/configure.sh -Targets servers -Arguments arg1 arg2
```

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** If an argument contains spaces or special characters, wrap them
> in single quotes.

### Requirements for running a script

Depending on a target's operating system, there are additional requirements for
running scripts:

- On Unix-like targets, your scripts must include a shebang line specifying the
  interpreter. For example, a Bash script should provide the path to the Bash
  interpreter:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo hello
  ```

- For Windows targets, you might need to enable file extensions. By default,
  Windows targets support the extensions `.ps1`, `.rb`, and `.pp`. To add
  additional file extensions, add them to the `winrm` configuration section of
  your inventory file:

  ```yaml
  # inventory.yaml
  config:
    winrm:
      extensions:
        - .py
        - .pl
  ```

## Run a task

Tasks are single actions that you can execute on a target. They are similar
to scripts, but have metadata, accept structured input, and return structured
output. You can write tasks that are specific to your project or download
modules from the Puppet Forge that include tasks.

To run a task, provide the name of the task and a list of targets to run the
task on.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt task run facts --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltTask -Name facts -Targets servers
```

### Pass parameters to a task

If a task accepts parameters, you can pass them to Bolt as part of the command.

_\*nix shell command_

To pass parameters to a task, add parameter declarations of the form
`parameter=value` to the command:

```shell
bolt task run package action=status name=apache2 --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

To pass parameters to a task, add an object with parameter declarations to
the command:

```powershell
Invoke-BoltTask -Name package -Targets servers -Params @{action='status';name='apache2'}
```

## Run a plan

Plans are sets of tasks and commands that can be combined with other logic. They
allow you to do complex operations, such as running multiple tasks with one
command, computing values for the input for a task, or running certain tasks
based on the results of another task. Similar to tasks, you can write plans that
are specific to your project or download modules from the Puppet Forge that
include plans.

To run a plan, provide the name of the plan.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt plan run myplan
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltPlan -Name myplan
```

### Pass parameters to a plan

If a plan accepts parameters, you can pass them to Bolt as part of the command.

_\*nix shell command_

To pass parameters to a plan, add parameter declarations of the form
`parameter=value` to the command:

```shell
bolt plan run reboot targets=servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

To pass parameters to a task, add an object with parameter declarations to
the command:

```powershell
Invoke-BoltTask -Name reboot -Params @{targets='servers'}
```

### Pass targets to a plan parameter 

If a plan accepts a `targets` parameter with the type `TargetSpec`, you can
use the `targets` command-line option to provide a value to the parameter.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt task run reboot --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltPlan -Name reboot -Targets servers
```

## Upload a file or directory

Bolt can copy files and directories from your workstation to remote targets. To
upload a file or directory, provide the `source` path on your workstation, the
`destination` path on the remote target that it should be copied to, and a
list of targets.

Both the `source` and `destination` accept absolute and relative paths. If you
provide a relative path as the `destination`, Bolt will copy the file relative
to the current working directory on the target. Typically, the current working
directory for the target is the log-in user's home directory.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt file upload /path/to/source /path/to/destination --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Send-BoltFile -Source /path/to/source -Destination /path/to/destination -Targets servers
```

## Download a file or directory

Bolt can copy files and directories from remote targets to a destination
directory on your workstation. To download a file or directory, provide the
`source` path on the remote target, the path to the `destination` directory on
the workstation, and a list of targets.

Both the `source` and `destination` accept absolute and relative paths. If you
provide a relative path as the `source`, Bolt will copy the file relative to the
current working directory on the target. Typically, the current working
directory for the target is the log-in user's home directory.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt file download /path/to/source /path/to/destination --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Receive-BoltFile -Source /path/to/source -Destination /path/to/destination -Targets servers
```

The `destination` on the workstation is a path to a directory that the downloaded
file or directory is copied to. If the `destination` directory does not exist,
Bolt will create it for you.

Bolt saves each file or directory it downloads to a subdirectory of the
`destination` directory that matches the URL-encoded name of the target it was
downloaded from. The target directory names are URL-encoded to ensure that they
are valid directory names.

For example, the following command downloads the SSH daemon configuration file from
two targets, `linux` and `ssh://example.com`, saving it to the destination
directory `sshd_config`:

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt file download /etc/ssh/sshd_config sshd_config --targets linux,ssh://example.com
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Receive-BoltFile -Source /etc/ssh/sshd_config -Destination sshd_config -Targets linux,ssh://example.com
```

After running this command from the root of your project directory, your project
directory structure would look similar to this:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ bolt-project.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.yaml
â””â”€â”€ sshd_config/
    â”œâ”€â”€ linux/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sshd_config
    â””â”€â”€ ssh%3A%2F%2Fexample.com/
        â””â”€â”€ sshd_config
```

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** To avoid creating directories with special characters, give your
> targets a simple, human-readable name.

## Apply Puppet code

### Apply Puppet code from a file

You can directly apply Puppet code from a file containing Puppet code (known as
a manifest) to your targets. To apply Puppet manifest code to a target, provide
the path to the manifest file and a list of targets.

The Puppet Agent package needs to be installed on the target for the manifest
code to be run. When you apply Puppet manifest code, Bolt ensures that the
Puppet Agent package is installed on the target.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt apply manifests/servers.pp --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltApply -Manifest manifests/servers.pp -Targets servers
```

### Apply Puppet code from the command line

You can also apply Puppet code directly to your targets, without the need
for writing it to a file first. To apply Puppet code directly to a target,
use the `execute` command-line option.

_\*nix shell command_

```shell
bolt apply --execute "file { '/etc/puppetlabs': ensure => present }" --targets servers
```

_PowerShell cmdlet_

```powershell
Invoke-BoltApply -Execute "file { '/etc/puppetlabs': ensure => present}" -Targets servers
```
