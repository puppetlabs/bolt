## Install Bolt as a gem

To install Bolt reliably and with all dependencies, use one of the Bolt
installation packages instead of a gem. Gem installations do not include core
modules which are required for common Bolt actions.

To install Bolt as a gem:

```shell
gem install bolt
```

## Install gems in Bolt's Ruby environment

Bolt packages include their own copy of Ruby.

When you install gems for use with Bolt, use the `--user-install` command-line
option to avoid requiring privileged access for installation. This option also
enables sharing gem content with Puppet installations â such as when running
`apply` on `localhost` â that use the same Ruby version.

To install a gem for use with Bolt, use the command appropriate to your
operating system:
- On Windows with the default install location:
    ```
    "C:/Program Files/Puppet Labs/Bolt/bin/gem.bat" install --user-install <GEM>
    ```
- On other platforms:
    ```
    /opt/puppetlabs/bolt/bin/gem install --user-install <GEM>
    ```
