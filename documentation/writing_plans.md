# Writing plans in Puppet language

Plans allow you to run more than one task with a single command, compute values for the input to a task, process the results of tasks, or make decisions based on the result of running a task.

Write plans in the Puppet language, giving them a `.pp` extension, and place them in the module's `/plans` directory.

Plans can use any combination of [Bolt functions](plan_functions.md#) or [built-in Puppet functions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.1/function.html).

- [Converting YAML plans to Puppet language plans](writing_yaml_plans.md#)

## Naming plans

Plan names are based on the filename of the plan, the name of the module containing the plan, and the path to the plan within the module.

Place plan files in your module's `./plans` directory, using these file extensions:

-   Puppet plans — `.pp`
-   YAML plans — `.yaml`, not `.yml`

Plan names are composed of two or more name segments, indicating:

-   The name of the module the plan is located in.
-   The name of the plan file, without the extension.
-   The path within the module, if the plan is in a subdirectory of `./plans`.


For example, given a module called `mymodule` with a plan defined in `./mymodule/plans/myplan.pp`, the plan name is `mymodule::myplan`. A plan defined in `./mymodule/plans/service/myplan.pp` would be `mymodule::service::myplan`. This name is how you refer to the plan when you run commands.

The plan filename `init` is special. You reference an `init` plan using the module name only. For example, in a module called `mymodule`, the plan defined in `init.pp` is the `mymodule` plan.

Avoid giving plans the same names as constructs in the Puppet language. Although plans do not share their namespace with other language constructs, giving plans these names makes your code difficult to read.

Each plan name segment must begin with a lowercase letter and:

-   Can include lowercase letters.
-   Can include digits.
-   Can include underscores.
-   Must not be a [reserved word](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.3/lang_reserved.html).
-   Must not have the same name as any Puppet data types.
-   Namespace segments must match the regular expression: `\A[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\Z`.


## Defining plan parameters

You can specify parameters in your plan.

Specify each parameter in your plan with its data type. For example, you might want parameters to specify which targets to run different parts of your plan on.

The following example shows target parameters specified as data type `TargetSpec`. `TargetSpec` accepts a URI string, a target object, or an array of URI strings and Target objects. Using `TargetSpec` allows you to pass, for each parameter, either a target object by name or a URI string. URI strings must include a hostname, and can also set the protocol, the username, the password, and the port to use using the format `protocol://user:password@hostname:port`.

The plan then calls the `run_task` function, specifying which targets to run the tasks on. The target names are collected and stored in `$webserver_names` by iterating over the list of target objects returned by `get_targets`. Task parameters are serialized to JSON format; therefore, extracting the names into an array of strings ensures that the `webservers` parameter is in a format that can be converted to JSON.

```
plan mymodule::my_plan(
  TargetSpec $load_balancer,
  TargetSpec $webservers,
) {

  # Extract the Target name from $webservers
  $webserver_names = get_targets($webservers).map |$n| { $n.name }
  
  # process webservers
  run_task('mymodule::lb_remove', $load_balancer, webservers => $webserver_names)
  run_task('mymodule::update_frontend_app', $webservers, version => '1.2.3')
  run_task('mymodule::lb_add', $load_balancer, webservers => $webserver_names)
 }
```

To execute this plan from the command line, pass the parameters as `<PARAMETER>=<VALUE>`. The `Targetspec` accepts either an array as JSON, or a comma separated string of target names.

```
bolt plan run mymodule::myplan --modulepath ./PATH/TO/MODULES load_balancer=lb.myorg.com webservers='["kermit.myorg.com","gonzo.myorg.com"]'
        
```

Parameters that are passed to the `run_*` plan functions are serialized to JSON.

To illustrate this concept, consider this plan:

```
plan test::parameter_passing (
  TargetSpec $targets,
  Optional[String[1]] $example_nul = undef,
) {
  return run_task('test::demo_undef_bash', $targets, example_nul => $example_nul)
}
```

The default value of `$example_nul` is `undef`. The plan calls the `test::demo_undef_bash` with the `example_nul` parameter. The implementation of the `demo_undef_bash.sh` task is:

```shell script
#!/bin/bash
example_env=$PT_example_nul
echo "Environment: $PT_example_nul"
echo "Stdin:" 
cat -
```

By default, the task expects parameters passed as a JSON string on standard input (stdin) to be accessible in prefixed environment variables.

Consider the output of running the plan against localhost:

```console
bolt@bolt: bolt plan run test::parameter_passing -n localhost
Starting: plan test::parameter_passing
Starting: task test::demo_undef_bash on localhost
Finished: task test::demo_undef_bash with 0 failures in 0.0 sec
Finished: plan test::parameter_passing in 0.01 sec
Finished on localhost:
  Environment: null
  Stdin:
  {"example_nul":null,"_task":"test::demo_undef_bash"}
  {
  }
Successful on 1 target: localhost
Ran on 1 target
```

The parameters `example_nul` and `_task` metadata are passed to the task as a JSON string over stdin.

Similarly, parameters are made available to the task as environment variables where the name of the parameter is converted to an environment variable prefixed with `PT_`. The prefixed environment variable points to the `String` representation in `JSON` format of the parameter value. So, the `PT_example_nul` environment variable has the value of `null` of type `String`.

## Returning results from plans

Use plans to return results that you can use in other plans or save for use outside of Bolt.

Plans, unlike functions, are primarily run for side effects, but they can optionally return a result. To return a result from a plan, use the `return` function. Any plan that does not call the `return` function returns `undef`.

```
plan return_result(
  $targets
) {
  return run_task('mytask', $targets)
}
```

The result of a plan must match the `PlanResult` type alias. This roughly includes JSON types as well as the plan language types which have well defined JSON representations in Bolt.

-   `Undef`
-   `String`
-   `Numeric`
-   `Boolean`
-   `Target`
-   `Result`
-   `ResultSet`
-   `Error`
-   `Array` with only `PlanResult`
-   `Hash` with `String` keys and `PlanResult` values

or

```
Variant[Data, String, Numeric, Boolean, Error, Result, ResultSet, Target, Array[Boltlib::PlanResult], Hash[String, Boltlib::PlanResult]]

```

## Returning errors in plans

To return an error if your plan fails, call the `fail_plan` function.

Specify parameters to provide details about the failure.

For example, if called with `run_plan('mymodule::myplan')`, this would return an error to the caller:

```
plan mymodule::myplan {
  fail_plan("Sorry, this plan does not work yet.", 'mymodule/error')
}
```

## Success and failure in plans

Indicators that a plan has run successfully or failed.

Any plan that completes execution without an error is considered successful. The `bolt` command exits `0` and any calling plans continue execution. If any calls to `run_` functions fail **without** `_catch_errors` then the plan halts execution and is considered a failure. Any calling plans also halt until a `run_plan` call with `_catch_errors` or a `catch_errors` block is reached. If one isn't reached, the `bolt` command will exit `2`. When writing a plan, if you have reason to believe it has failed, you can fail the plan with the `fail_plan` function. This causes the bolt command to exit `2` and prevents calling plans executing any further, unless `run_plan` was called with `_catch_errors` or in a `catch_errors` block.

### Failing plans

If `upload_file`, `run_command`, `run_script`, or `run_task` are called without the `_catch_errors` option and they fail on any targets, the plan itself fails. To fail a plan directly, call the `fail_plan` function. Create an error with a message and include the kind, details, or issue code, or pass an existing error to it.

```
fail_plan('The plan is failing', 'mymodules/pear-shaped', {'failedtargets' => $result.error_set.names})
# or
fail_plan($errorobject)
```

### Catching errors in plans

Bolt includes a `catch_errors` function that executes a block of code and returns the error if an error is raised, or returns the result of the block if no errors are raised. You might get an `Error` object returned if you: 
- call `run_plan` with `_catch_errors`. 
- use a `catch_errors` block.
- call the `error` method on a result.

The `Error` data type includes:

-   `msg`: The error message string.
-   `kind`: A string that defines the kind of error similar to an error class.
-   `details`: A hash with details about the error from a task or from information about the state of a plan when it fails, for example, `exit_code` or `stack_trace`.
-   `issue_code`: A unique code for the message that can be used for translation.


Use the `Error` data type in a case expression to match against different kinds of errors. To recover from certain errors, while failing on or ignoring others, set up your plan to include conditionals based on errors that occur while your plan runs. For example, you can set up a plan to retry a task when a timeout error occurs, but to fail when there is an authentication error.

Below, the first plan continues whether it succeeds or fails with a `mymodule/not-serious` error. Other errors cause the plan to fail.

```
plan mymodule::handle_errors {
  $result = run_plan('mymodule::myplan', '_catch_errors' => true)
  case $result {
    Error['mymodule/not-serious'] : {
      notice("${result.message}")
    }
    Error : { fail_plan($result) } }
  run_plan('mymodule::plan2')
}
```

Using the `catch_errors` function:

```
plan test (String[1] $role) {
  $result_or_error = catch_errors(['bolt/puppetdb-error']) || {
    puppetdb_query("inventory[certname] { app_role == ${role} }")
  }
  $targets = if $result_or_error =~ Error {
    # If the PuppetDB query fails
    warning("Could not fetch from puppet. Using defaults instead")
    # TargetSpec string
    "all"
  } else {
    $result_or_error
  }
}
```

## Puppet and Ruby functions in plans

You can define and call Puppet language functions and Ruby functions in plans.

This is useful for packaging common general logic in your plan. You can also call the plan functions, such as `run_task` or `run_plan`, from within a function.

Not all Puppet language constructs are allowed in plans. The following constructs are not allowed:

-   Defined types
-   Classes
-   Resource expressions, such as `file { title: mode => '0777' }`
-   Resource default expressions, such as `File { mode => '0666' }`
-   Resource overrides, such as `File['/tmp/foo'] { mode => '0444' }`
-   Relationship operators: `-> <- ~> <~`
-   Functions that operate on a catalog: `include`, `require`, `contain`, `create_resources`
-   Collector expressions, such as `SomeType <| |>`, `SomeType <<| |>>`
-   ERB templates are not supported. Use EPP instead

Be aware of a few other Puppet behaviors in plans:

-   The `--strict_variables` option is on, so if you reference a variable that is not set, you get an error.
-   `--strict=error` is always on, so minor language issues generate errors. For example `{ a => 10, a => 20 }` is an error because there is a duplicate key in the hash.
-   Most Puppet settings are empty and not-configurable when using Bolt.
-   Logs include "source location" (file, line) instead of resource type or name.

## Handling plan function results

Plan execution functions each return a result object that returns details about the execution.

Each [execution function](plan_functions.md#) returns an object type `ResultSet`. For each target that the execution takes place on, this object contains a `Result` object. The [apply action](applying_manifest_blocks.md#) returns a `ResultSet` containing `ApplyResult` objects.

A `ResultSet` has the following methods:

-   `names()`: The `String` names (target URIs) of all targets in the set as an `Array`.
-   `empty()`: Returns `Boolean` if the execution result set is empty.
-   `count()`: Returns an `Integer` count of targets.
-   `first()`: The first `Result` object, useful to unwrap single results.
-   `find(String $target_name)`: Look up the `Result` for a specific target.
-   `error_set()`: A `ResultSet` containing only the results of failed targets.
-   `ok_set()`: A `ResultSet` containing only the successful results.
-   `filter_set(block)`: Filters a `ResultSet` with the given block and returns a `ResultSet` object (where the [filter function](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/function.html#filter) returns an array or hash).
-   `targets()`: An array of all the `Target` objects from every `Result` in the set.
-   `ok():` `Boolean` that is the same as `error_targets.empty`.
-   `to_data()`: An array of hashes representing either `Result` or `ApplyResults`.
-   `[]`: Array indexing allows accessing a single `Result` (for example `$result[0]`) or an array of results (for example `$result[0,2]`)


A `Result` has the following methods:

-   `value()`: The hash containing the value of the `Result`.
-   `target()`: The `Target` object that the `Result` is from.
-   `error()`: An `Error` object constructed from the `_error` in the value.
-   `message()`: The `_output` key from the value.
-   `ok()`: Returns `true` if the `Result` was successful.
-   `[]`: Accesses the value hash directly.
-   `to_data()`: Hash representation of `Result`.
-   `action()`: String representation of result type (task, command, etc.).


An `ApplyResult` has the following methods:

-   `report()`: The hash containing the Puppet report from the application.
-   `target()`: The `Target` object that the `Result` is from.
-   `error()`: An `Error` object constructed from the `_error` in the value.
-   `ok()`: Returns `true` if the `Result` was successful.
-   `to_data()`: Hash representation of `ApplyResult`.
-   `action()`: String representation of result type (apply).


An instance of `ResultSet` is `Iterable` as if it were an `Array[Variant[Result, ApplyResult]]` so that iterative functions such as `each`, `map`, `reduce`, or `filter` work directly on the `ResultSet` returning each result.

This example checks if a task ran correctly on all targets. If it did not, the check fails:

```
$r = run_task('sometask', ..., '_catch_errors' => true)
unless $r.ok {
  fail("Running sometask failed on the targets ${r.error_targets.names}")
}
```

You can do iteration and checking if the result is an Error. This example outputs feedback about the result of a task:

```
$r = run_task('sometask', ..., '_catch_errors' => true)
$r.each |$result| {
  $target = $result.target.name
  if $result.ok {
    notice("${target} returned a value: ${result.value}")
  } else {
    notice("${target} errored with a message: ${result.error.message}")
  }
}
```

Similarly, you can iterate over the array of hashes returned by calling `to_data` on a `ResultSet` and access hash values. For example:

```
$r = run_command('whoami', 'localhost,local://0.0.0.0')
$r.to_data.each |$result_hash| { notice($result_hash['result']['stdout']) }
```

You can also use `filter_set` to filter a `ResultSet` and apply a `ResultSet` function such as `targets` to the output:

```
$filtered = $result.filter_set |$r| {
  $r['tag'] == "you're it"
}.targets
```

## Passing sensitive data to tasks

Task parameters defined as sensitive are masked when they appear in plans.

You define a task parameter as sensitive with the metadata property `"sensitive": true`. When a task runs, the values for these sensitive parameters are masked.

```
run_task('task_with_secrets', ..., password => '$ecret!')
```

### Working with the sensitive function

In Puppet you use the `Sensitive` function to mask data in output logs. Because plans are written in Puppet DSL, you can use this type freely. The `run_task()` function does not allow parameters of `Sensitive` function to be passed. When you need to pass a sensitive value to a task, you must unwrap it prior to calling `run_task()`.

```
$pass = Sensitive('$ecret!')
run_task('task_with_secrets', ..., password => $pass.unwrap)
```

## Target objects

The target object represents a target and its specific connection options.

The state of a target is stored in the inventory for the duration of a plan, allowing you to collect facts or set variables for a target and retrieve them later. You can get a printable representation via the `name` function, as well as access components of the target: `protocol, host, port, user, password`.

### `TargetSpec`

The execution function takes a parameter with the type alias `TargetSpec`. `TargetSpec` accepts a URI string, a target object, or an array of URI strings and Target objects. Generally, use this type for plans that accept a set of targets as a parameter, to ensure clean interaction with the CLI and other plans. To operate on individual targets, resolve it to a list via `get_targets`. For example, to loop over each target in a plan, accept a `TargetSpec` argument, but call `get_targets` on it before looping.

```
plan loop(TargetSpec $targets) {
  get_targets($targets).each |$target| {
    run_task('my_task', $target)
  }
}
```

If your plan accepts a single `TargetSpec` parameter, you can call that parameter `targets` so that it can be specified with the `--targets` flag from the command line.

### Creating target objects

Creating target objects in a plan means they are part of the in-memory inventory - they can be
referenced and run alongside targets that are loaded from the inventory file, but their data is not
saved between plan runs. They only exist for the life cycle of the plan run.

There are two main ways you might want to instantiate target objects within a plan: getting a target
that might already exist, or making a new target object that clobbers any existing targets with the
same name. 

To get or create a target, use the `get_target` function. This takes a single URI and returns a
single target object with the same name if it already exists in the inventory, otherwise it will
create the target and return it. Similarly `get_targets` takes an array of URIs, gets or creates
each target, and returns an array of target objects. Some transport options can be [configured in
the URI string](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/configuring_bolt.html), but if this isn't
sufficient you can use
[set_config](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#set-config) to set configuration options on the targets.

Use `Target.new()` to create a target that clobbers an existing target with the same name. `Target.new()`
takes a data hash with the same keys as [inventory target
definitions](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file_v2.html#target-object). You can use
this to configure more options for the target than are available in the URI alone, but it is a
destructive action: if you try to create a target with the same name as a target that already exists
in the inventory (either from in-memory or from the file), the old target will be completely
destroyed and replaced with the new target.

All new targets are added to the `all` inventory group, and no other groups. See [modifying target
objects](#modifying-target-objects) for information on modifying group membership.

```
plan create_targets(
  TargetSpec $targetspecs
) {
  # Create a single Target object
  $target1 = get_target('ssh://user:password@myhostname.com:8022')
  $target2 = get_target('2hostname2handle')

  # Create an array of Target objects
  $target_list = get_targets('host1', 'host2', 'hostred', 'hostblue')
  # This also accepts TargetSpec objects
  $listy_list = get_targets($targetspecs)
  # And inventory group names
  $listerine = get_targets('all')

  # Create a Target object with options
  $opts_hash = {'uri' => 'myuri',
                'name' => 'nodename',
                'config' => {
                  'transport' => 'ssh',
                  'ssh' => {
                    'host-key-check' => false
                  }
                }
              }
  $with_opts = Target.new($opts_hash)

  # All of these target vars can be operated on
  run_command('hostname', $target1)
}
```

### Modifying target objects

There are a handful of functions available to modify existing target objects inside a plan:

* [add_facts](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#add-facts)
* [add_to_group](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#add-to-group)
* [remove_from_group](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#remove-from-group)
* [set_config](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#set-config)
* [set_feature](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#set-feature)
* [set_var](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/plan_functions.html#set-var)

These can be used to add facts, transport specific configuration options, features, and variables to
target objects, as well as add or remove objects from existing [inventory
groups](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html). Targets are modified in-memory
for the life cycle of the plan and are not saved between plan runs.

### Variables and facts on targets

When Bolt runs, it loads transport configuration values, variables, and facts from the inventory. These can be accessed with the `$target.facts()` and `$target.vars()` functions. During the course of a plan, you can update the facts or variables for any target. Facts usually come from running `facter` or another fact collection application on the target, or from a fact store like PuppetDB. Variables are computed externally or assigned directly.

Set variables in a plan using `$target.set_var`:

```
plan vars(String $host) {
	$target = get_targets($host)[0]
	$target.set_var('newly_provisioned', true)
	$targetvars = $target.vars
	run_command("echo 'Vars for ${host}: ${$targetvars}'", $host)
}
```

Or set variables in the inventory file using the `vars` key at the group level.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: my_targets
    targets:
      - localhost
    vars:
      operatingsystem: windows
    config:
      transport: ssh
```

### Collect facts from the targets

The facts plan connects to the target and discovers facts. It stores these facts on the targets in the inventory for later use.

The methods used to collect facts:

-   On `ssh` targets, it runs a Bash script.
-   On `winrm` targets, it runs a PowerShell script.
-   On `pcp` or targets where the Puppet agent is present, it runs Facter.

This example collects facts with the facts plan and uses those facts to decide which task to run on the targets.

```
plan run_with_facts(TargetSpec $targets) {
  # This collects facts on targets and updates the inventory
  run_plan(facts, targets => $targets)

  $centos_targets = get_targets($targets).filter |$n| { $n.facts['os']['name'] == 'CentOS' }
  $ubuntu_targets = get_targets($targets).filter |$n| { $n.facts['os']['name'] == 'Ubuntu' }
  run_task(centos_task, $centos_targets)
  run_task(ubuntu_task, $ubuntu_targets)
}
```

### Collect facts from PuppetDB

When targets are running a Puppet agent and sending facts to PuppetDB, you can use the `puppetdb_fact` plan to collect facts for them. This example collects facts with the `puppetdb_fact` plan, and uses those facts to decide which task to run on the targets. You must configure the PuppetDB client before you run it.

```
plan run_with_facts(TargetSpec $targets) {
  # This collects facts on targets and update the inventory
  run_plan(**puppetdb_fact**, targets => $targets)

  $centos_targets = get_targets($targets).filter |$n| { $n.facts['os']['name'] == 'CentOS' }
  $ubuntu_targets = get_targets($targets).filter |$n| { $n.facts['os']['name'] == 'Ubuntu' }
  run_task(centos_task, $centos_targets)
  run_task(ubuntu_task, $ubuntu_targets)
}
```

### Collect general data from PuppetDB

You can use the `puppetdb_query` function in plans to make direct queries to PuppetDB. For example, you can discover targets from PuppetDB and run tasks on them. You'll have to configure the PuppetDB client before running it. You can learn how to structure Puppet Query Language (PQL) queries using [the PQL tutorial](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/query/tutorial-pql.html). For information, see [the PQL reference guide](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/query/v4/pql.html).

```
plan pdb_discover {
  $result = puppetdb_query("inventory[certname] { app_role == 'web_server' }")
  # extract the certnames into an array
  $names = $result.map |$r| { $r["certname"] }
  # wrap in url. You can skip this if the default transport is pcp
  $targets = $names.map |$n| { "pcp://${n}" }
  run_task('my_task', $targets)
}
```

## Plan logging

Plan run information can be captured in log files or printed to a terminal session using the following methods.

### Outputting message to the terminal

Print message strings to `STDOUT` using the plan function `out::message`. This function always prints messages regardless of the log level and doesn't log them to the log file.

### Puppet log functions

To generate log messages from a plan, use the Puppet log function that corresponds to the level you want to track: `error`, `warn`, `notice`, `info`, or `debug`. Configure the log level for both log files and console logging in `bolt.yaml`. The default log level for the console is `warn` and for log files is `notice`. Use the `--debug` flag to set the console log level to `debug` for a single run.

### Default action logging

Bolt logs actions that a plan takes on targets through the  `upload_file`,  `run_command`, `run_script`, or `run_task` functions. By default, it logs a notice level message when an action starts and another when it completes. If you pass a description to the function, that is used in place of the generic log message.

```
run_task(my_task, $targets, "Better description", param1 => "val")
```

If your plan contains many small actions, you might want to suppress these messages and use explicit calls to the Puppet log functions instead. This can be accomplished by wrapping actions in a `without_default_logging` block, which causes the action messages to be logged at info level instead of notice. For example to loop over a series of targets without logging each action:

```
plan deploy( TargetSpec $targets) {
  without_default_logging() || {
    get_targets($targets).each |$target| {
      run_task(deploy, $target)
    }
  }
}
```

To avoid complications with parser ambiguity, always call `without_default_logging` with `()` and empty block args `||`.

```
without_default_logging() || { run_command('echo hi', $targets) }
```

not

```
without_default_logging { run_command('echo hi', $targets) }
```
