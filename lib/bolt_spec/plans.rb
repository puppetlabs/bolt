# These helpers are intended to be used for plan unit testing without calling
# out to target nodes. It accomplishes this by replacing bolt's executor with a
# mock executor. The mock executor allows calls to run_* functions to be
# stubbed out for testing. By default this executor will fail on any run_*
# call but stubs can be set up with allow_* and expect_* functions.
#
# Stub matching
#
# Stubs match invocations of run_* functions by default matching any call but
# with_targets and with_params helpers can further restrict the stub to match
# more exact invocations. It's possible a call to run_* could match multiple
# stubs. In this case the mock executor will first check for stubs specifically
# matching the task being run after which it will use the last stub that
# matched
#
#
# allow vs expect
#
# Stubs have two general modes bases on whether the test is making assertions
# on whether function was called. Allow stubs allow the run_* invocation  to
# be called any number of times while expect stubs will fail if no run_*
# invocation matches them. The be_called_times(n) stub method can be used to
# ensure an allow stub is not called more than n times or that an expect stub
# is called exactly n times.
#
# Configuration
#
#  To configure Puppet and Bolt at the beginning of tests, add the following
#  line to your spec_helper.rb:
#
#  BoltSpec::Plans.init
#
#  By default the plan helpers use the modulepath set up for rspec-puppet and
#  an otherwise empty bolt config and inventory. To create your own values for
#  these override the modulepath, config, or inventory methods.
#
#
#  TODO:
#  - Allow description based stub matching
#  - Better testing of plan errors
#  - Better error collection around call counts. Show what stubs exists and more than a single failure
#  - Allow stubbing with a block(at the double level? As a matched stub?)
#  - package code so that it can be used for testing modules outside of this repo
#  - set subject from describe and provide matchers similar to rspec puppets function tests
#
#  MAYBE TODO?:
#  - allow stubbing for subplans
#  - validate call expectations at the end of the example instead of in run_plan
#  - resultset matchers to help testing canary like plans?
#  - inventory matchers to help testing plans that change inventory
#
# Stubs:
# - allow_command(cmd), expect_command(cmd): expect the exact command
# - allow_script(script), expect_script(script): expect the script as <module>/path/to/file
# - allow_task(task), expect_task(task): expect the named task
# - allow_upload(file), expect_upload(file): expect the identified source file
# - allow_apply_prep: allows `apply_prep` to be invoked in the plan but does not allow modifiers
# - allow_apply: allows `apply` to be invoked in the plan but does not allow modifiers
# - allow_out_message, expect_out_message: expect a message to be passed to out::message (only modifiers are
#   be_called_times(n), with_params(params), and not_be_called)
#
# Stub modifiers:
# - be_called_times(n): if allowed, fail if the action is called more than 'n' times
#                       if expected, fail unless the action is called 'n' times
# - not_be_called: fail if the action is called
# - with_targets(targets): target or list of targets that you expect to be passed to the action
# - with_params(params): list of params and metaparams (or options) that you expect to be passed to the action.
#                        Corresponds to the action's last argument.
# - with_destination(dest): for upload_file, the expected destination path
# - always_return(value): return a Bolt::ResultSet of Bolt::Result objects with the specified value Hash
#                         command and script: only accept 'stdout' and 'stderr' keys
#                         upload: does not support this modifier
# - return_for_targets(targets_to_values): return a Bolt::ResultSet of Bolt::Result objects from the Hash mapping
#                                          targets to their value Hashes
#                                          command and script: only accept 'stdout' and 'stderr' keys
#                                          upload: does not support this modifier
# - return(&block): invoke the block to construct a Bolt::ResultSet. The blocks parameters differ based on action
#                   command: `{ |targets:, command:, params:| ... }`
#                   script: `{ |targets:, script:, params:| ... }`
#                   task: `{ |targets:, task:, params:| ... }`
#                   upload: `{ |targets:, source:, destination:, params:| ... }`
# - error_with(err): return a failing Bolt::ResultSet, with Bolt::Result objects with the identified err hash
#

#     it 'should return' do
