# Releasing Bolt 

Hello, fearless reader! This document details the release process for Bolt packages and the PuppetBolt
PowerShell module.

## Bolt packages

1. Generate the changelog using the `changelog` rake task.

   ```bash
   $ bundle exec rake changelog
   ```

   > **Note:** To use the rake task you must be a member of the `puppetlabs` organization and set the environment
   variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) that has
   `admin:read:org` permissions.

   Ensure all entries have a title, a link to the relevant issue or PR for the change,
   and a description of the changes. Each entry should look like the following:

   ```markdown
   * **Descriptive title of changes**
     ([#<ISSUE OR PR NUMBER>](<LINK TO ISSUE OR PR>)) 

     Descriptive summary of changes.
   ```
   
   Open a PR against `puppetlabs/bolt` and merge the changes into `main`.

1. Ensure that the [Bolt pipelines](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/) are green.

1. Build and stage packages with the 
   [init_bolt-release job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_bolt-vanagon_bolt-release-init_bolt-release/).
   Click on _Build with Parameters_ and set `NEW_TAG` to the next tagged version of Bolt. Click _Build_.

1. Once packages are staged and you are ready to push them to public repositories, run the
   [release job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_ship-bolt_stage-foss-artifacts-all-repos/).
   Click on _Build with Parameters_ and set `REFS` to the next tagged version of Bolt. Click _Build_. 
   
   Once the release pipeline is complete it will kick off additional jobs, including the
   [puppet-bolt docker job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_ship-bolt_build_and_push_bolt_docker_image/)
   and [docs publishing job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_ship-bolt_publish_docs/).
   If these jobs are not kicked off automatically, they can be triggered manually without affecting the release.

1. After packages are made public, update the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/puppetlabs/homebrew-puppet) with the
   new version of Bolt. Checkout a new release branch and run the following rake task:

   ```bash
   $ rake 'brew:cask[puppet-bolt]'
   ```

   Open a PR against `puppetlabs/homebrew-puppet`, wait for the Travis CI tests to pass, and then merge to
   `master`

1. Once packages are public, send an email to the `internal-puppet-products-update` group with the release
   notes and announce the new version in the `#bolt` channel on the community Slack.

## PuppetBolt PowerShell module

After Bolt packages have been released, you can publish a new version of the [PuppetBolt PowerShell 
module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PuppetBolt).

1. Go to the [Publish PowerShell Module workflow](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/actions/workflows/publish-powershell-module.yaml).

1. Click the `Run workflow` button at the top of the list of workflow runs. Set the ref to the tagged 
   version of Bolt that you want to build the module for. The ref defaults to `main` and does not need
   to be modified if publishing the module after tagging and releasing Bolt.

1. Run the workflow!
